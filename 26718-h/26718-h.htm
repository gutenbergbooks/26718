<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<h3>BY THE GENERAL EDITOR</h3>


<p>This is the day of the small book. There is
much to be done. Time is short. Information
is earnestly desired, but it is wanted in compact
form, confined directly to the subject in view,
authenticated by real knowledge, and, withal,
gracefully delivered. It is to fulfill these conditions
that the present series has been projected&mdash;to
lend real assistance to those who are
looking about for new tools and fresh ideas.</p>

<p>It is addressed especially to the man and
woman at a distance from the libraries, exhibitions,
and daily notes of progress, which are
the main advantage, to a studious mind, of living
in or near a large city. The editor has had
in view, especially, the farmer and villager
who is striving to make the life of himself and
his family broader and brighter, as well as to
increase his bank account; and it is therefore
in the humane, rather than in a commercial direction,
that the Library has been planned.</p>

<p>The average American little needs advice on
the conduct of his farm or business; or, if he
thinks he does, a large supply of such help in
farming and trading as books and periodicals
can give, is available to him. But many a man
who is well to do and knows how to continue
to make money, is ignorant how to spend it in
a way to bring to himself, and confer upon his
wife and children, those conveniences, comforts
and niceties which alone make money worth
acquiring and life worth living. He hardly
realizes that they are within his reach.</p>

<p>For suggestion and guidance in this direction
there is a real call, to which this series is an
answer. It proposes to tell its readers how
they can make work easier, health more secure,
and the home more enjoyable and tenacious
of the whole family. No evil in American rural
life is so great as the tendency of the young
people to leave the farm and the village. The
only way to overcome this evil is to make rural
life less hard and sordid; more comfortable and
attractive. It is to the solving of that problem
that these books are addressed. Their central
idea is to show how country life may be made
richer in interest, broader in its activities and
its outlook, and sweeter to the taste.</p>

<p>To this end men and women who have given
each a lifetime of study and thought to his or
her specialty, will contribute to the Library,
and it is safe to promise that each volume will
join with its eminently practical information a
still more valuable stimulation of thought.</p>

<h3>IMPORTANCE OF OUR SUBJECT</h3>


<p>Notwithstanding the extraordinary advances
in a material way that have been accomplished
in this country within the last few decades, it
is a significant and most alarming fact that
progress in hygienic matters has lagged far
behind. Why this is, it would be very difficult
to say,&mdash;for the reason that the causes are perhaps
many. Chief among these, probably, is
the fact that our progress along industrial lines
has occupied the entire time of the majority
of our best intellects, and it is also in no small
degree the consequence of a fatalism that regards
disease as a direct visitation of providence
and therefore a thing which man may not
avoid. Another cause in some instances is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
pride of our people in their homes and respective
localities, which causes them to repel with
indignation the suggestion that any special
measures are necessary in order to conserve the
public health where they reside. Ignorant as
the average man is of the causes that produce
sickness and the means by which this result is
accomplished, he is naturally not in a position
to form a correct judgment concerning such
matters, and as a consequence, sees no reasons
for taking the precautions that are necessary in
order to ward off disease. This ignorance, it
must be confessed with sorrow, is in a measure
the fault of the medical profession, which has
not in the vast majority of instances lived up
to its ideals in this connection. Petty and unworthy
rivalry has played an extremely important
part in this failure of medical men to do
their duty in this particular&mdash;none of the physicians
of a community being, as a rule, willing
that others should instruct the public, however
vital this might be for the general good. As a
consequence, that class of vultures known as
medical quacks has furnished to the laity by
far the greater proportion of their instruction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
on hygienic subjects, with the result that the
average man has a greater misconception and
less real knowledge of such matters than of anything
else in which he is vitally interested.</p>

<p>Another, and very curious explanation for
our general disregard of the laws of health is
that our strong belief in ourselves impels us
to think that however much others may suffer
from things generally regarded as unhygienic,
we, ourselves, will be immune. This belief is
fostered by the fact that in early life there often
seems no end to our capacity to endure, and we
find ourselves constantly defying without apparent
harm, what we are told by others is
directly contrary to all rules of proper living.
But it is unfortunately true also that the reserve
force and great power of resistance that enables
us to do these things begins to wane towards
the end of the third decade of life, and we, therefore,
find ourselves sooner or later breaking
down after we have become thoroughly convinced
that we were made of iron, and that
while other people might not be able to do as
we were, it could not possibly result in evil in
our own cases.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>What a pity it is that the young will not learn
from the experience of those who have gone
before them! Could they only do so, how much
suffering and woe could be avoided in this
world. Unfortunately, however, there are few
men so constituted that they are willing to be
guided by the experience of those who have preceded
them, and there is but a faint possibility,
therefore, that any good can be accomplished
by warning the coming generation of the
troubles in store for them should they not heed
the advice of those who have suffered before
them. Notwithstanding this, the writer feels
that these words of warning should be spoken
to the young, since they, alas, are the only ones
to be benefited by such advice.</p>

<p><i>As you value your happiness materially, and
as you desire a healthy old age and a long life,
inform yourselves as to the few simple laws that
govern human existence, and attempt so far as
lies in your power to follow them. If you do
not do this, disaster will follow as surely as the
night follows the day.</i></p>

<p><i>Apathy of the Public as to Hygiene.</i>&mdash;As a
partial consequence, probably, of all the reasons<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
mentioned, along with others, there exists in
the popular mind a curious apathy concerning
hygienic matters&mdash;an apathy so great that it is
scarcely possible to get the average man to
discuss, much less to put in practice the all-important
laws that govern health. As a result of
the work of the various State boards of health
and of the Public Health and Marine Hospital
Service, this condition of affairs happily shows
some signs of abatement, and we certainly have
reasons to believe that the future promises
great things along these lines. No sign of this
change is more significant than the awakening
of the press of the country to the vast importance
of instructing the public in health matters,
and their changed attitude toward the charlatans
and quacks who live by promising the impossible.
Largely subsidized by the infamous
vendors of patent medicine, our newspapers
and magazines still lend their columns to these
human vampires who prey pre-eminently on
the ignorance and credulity of the hopelessly-diseased
poor; but within recent years some
of our foremost journals show signs of an
awakening of conscience, and a very few have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
even gone so far as to exclude advertisements
of this character altogether.</p>

<p>It has been said, certainly with more or less
truth, that we are creatures of our surroundings,
but whether we accept this in its broadest
sense or not, there can be no question that our
well being is most intimately connected with
those things with which we come into every day
contact. <i>Nothing is more important for us to
recognize than that our diseases are contracted
from neighboring subjects just in proportion
as we are closely associated with them.</i> From
our fellowmen we contract, as everyone knows,
a large number of diseases, either by direct contact
or by means of the air that surrounds us.
From the earth we get hook-worms and other
animal parasites, either by coming directly in
contact with it or through eating uncooked
fruits and vegetables. From water we get
typhoid fever, dysentery, cholera, and many
other parasitic diseases. From our food we
likewise contract dangerous maladies such as
tapeworms from uncooked meats and fish and
the deadly trichina from raw hog meat. With
decomposed breads we take the poisons that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
produce pellagra, kak-ke, ergotism and acrodinia.
From uncooked fruits and vegetables we
get dysentery, typhoid fever, cholera, and parasitic
diseases. Spoiled beans give us the deadly
lathyrismus. From decomposed meat and fish
we get ptomaine poisoning. Mosquitoes convey
to us malaria, yellow fever and a parasite
known as the filaria. The dreaded sleeping-sickness
of Africa comes through the bites of a
small fly; the bedbug is believed to be the
means of conveying a frightful disease known
as kala-azar, and the house-fly often brings to
us the germs that produce typhoid fever, dysentery,
and probably other diseases as well.</p>

<p>The bubonic plague, which is one of the most
frightful diseases known, is conveyed to man
by the rat and mouse.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Hydrophobia is usually
contracted from the bite of the dog, and it is
a well-known fact that this animal often harbors
a minute tapeworm, a single egg of which,
when swallowed by the human being, is often
followed by death. Both dogs and cats probably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
convey diphtheria, and both unquestionably
often have within their intestinal tracts
tapeworms that occasionally infect children.
With the exception of the rare disease known
as glanders, the horse is not believed to be directly
responsible for any of the maladies from
which the human being suffers, but it is well
established that fully 95 per cent. of house-flies
hatch in the manure of these animals, and
they, therefore, become indirectly responsible
for some of the most serious diseases affecting
the human being. It is thus seen that almost
every object with which man comes in intimate
contact is capable of conveying to him the
poison of one or more diseases. If it were possible
for us to separate ourselves completely
from everything with which we are ordinarily
associated there can be no question that the
span of human life would be greatly increased,
and that death from bacterial and parasitic diseases
generally would no longer occur. All this
is said not with the object of startling the
reader, but to warn him of the dangers that surround
him on every hand, and to urge a recognition
of that which can so materially prolong his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
life. Fortunately these sources of infection
may be almost entirely done away with by a few
simple rules of life, and the health and longevity
of mankind must necessarily be directly proportionate
to the care with which we observe
them.</p>

<p>It is now in order to discuss in detail the
subject of personal hygiene.</p>

<h3>CARE OF THE PERSON</h3>


<p>It is happily the case that in America the importance
of personal cleanliness is more
thoroughly understood, and is more generally
practiced than any of the other important
hygienic procedures. While it is true that there
are many&mdash;particularly those of foreign extraction,
and who live for the most part in the
larger cities&mdash;to whom an occasional bath appeals
only as a painful necessity, a very large
percentage of those born in this country bathe
regularly. It should be thoroughly understood
that a daily bath is essential, not only from the
standpoint of cleanliness, but from the fact that
this practice is in the highest degree conducive
to health. It should never be forgotten that by
cleanliness infectious materials are removed
from the surface of the body, and at the same
time the skin is put into a condition to eliminate
from the system those waste products<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
which it is its special function to remove. The
close relationship of the proper activity of the
skin to health is perhaps not generally sufficiently
appreciated&mdash;for it is true that the body
cannot remain normal when the secretory power
of its glands is impaired, and that even death
quickly follows when they cease to functionate
altogether.</p>

<p><i>Advice as to Bathing.</i>&mdash;Much difference of
opinion exists as to the proper temperature of
the water for bathing, some holding that it
should be quite cold, while others are equally
positive that it should be warm. Unfortunately
it is impossible to give fixed rules concerning
this somewhat important matter, for there is
every reason to believe that it should be determined
in each individual case according to
circumstances, and that, therefore, both may be
right. Some persons unquestionably do better
with one, and some with the other. It has been
established clearly that the cold bath is highly
stimulating, and where not too prolonged, and
when followed by vigorous rubbing, is undoubtedly
healthful for a large number of people.
The cold bath is often used by physicians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
in the treatment of diseases of low vitality.
Many persons however, are unpleasantly affected
by bathing in water of a temperature
much below that of the body; particularly is
this true of women, and the like may be said of
thin and nervous persons of the other sex. It
is claimed by the advocates of the cold bath
that those who practice this procedure daily
are practically immune from colds, but this,
certainly, is not always true; on the contrary
the writer has seen instances where the cold
bath has unquestionably led to chronic nasal
catarrh, with increased tendency to inflammatory
conditions of the air passages. It is also
the case that baths of this description tend in
some persons to prevent a normal accumulation
of fat beneath the skin, and keep individuals
of this kind unnaturally lean.</p>

<p>The warm bath is perhaps, on the whole,
more popular than the cold, since it is preferred
usually by children and women, and is practiced
by a considerable proportion of adult males.
It is unquestionably somewhat enervating, and
at best fails entirely to give the agreeable
stimulation experienced by those who take a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
cold plunge. It is, however, to be preferred in
those instances where cold water produces disagreeable
effects, and if the bath be not too
long continued it is followed by no ill results.
Persons who become lean under cold baths not
uncommonly take on flesh when they begin to
use warm ones. It is unquestionably true that
the latter is to be preferred in hot climates.</p>

<p>The sea bath is invigorating not only from
the water being cool, but as a consequence of the
pleasurable excitement with which it is attended.
Its greatest disadvantage lies in the
fact that there is a tendency to overdo it, many
persons remaining in the water for hours. Ten
or fifteen minutes is as long as the average
person should indulge in sea-bathing, and it is
a question if even those who are young and
vigorous should remain in the water longer than
half an hour.</p>

<p>Bathing of any kind should be indulged in
before meals, the best time being before breakfast
in the morning.</p>

<p><i>Care of the Teeth.</i>&mdash;Nothing in connection
with the subject of personal hygiene is of more
importance than keeping the teeth properly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
cleansed. The fact is not generally appreciated
that sound teeth stand in a most intimate
relationship with good health, and that disastrous
consequences are sure to follow sooner or
later where these most important structures
are neglected.</p>

<p>While it is true that in a person of vigorous
health one or two decayed teeth do not, as a
rule, occasion obvious trouble at once, ill effects
are sure sooner or later to be felt. For
one thing, a person without good teeth cannot
chew his food well. Those who begin by neglecting
what at first are slight defects in the
teeth seem to acquire in the course of time a
sort of habit of doing this, and ultimately disregard
and fail to have corrected the more serious
diseases of the dental structures. Nothing
is more common than for the practicing physician
to find patients with one or more teeth
partially gone, or, even worse, with only the
exposed roots remaining.</p>

<p>Where cavities exist, food is constantly forced
into them, and undergoing decomposition, the
breath of their owner becomes foul, and portions
of decayed food mixed with multitudes of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
bacteria are constantly swallowed; sooner or
later there inevitably follows under such
circumstances catarrhal conditions of the
stomach, which reaches a point in some individuals
where the health is seriously threatened.
Not only do bad teeth produce trouble in the
way just mentioned, but there is every reason
to believe that germs that produce disease&mdash;particularly
those that cause consumption&mdash;not
uncommonly find their way to the interior of
the body through the resulting cavities.</p>

<p>It is the duty of everyone to properly cleanse
the teeth at least once daily&mdash;to do so after each
meal would be even still better. This should
be done with a moderately soft brush, with
which it is unnecessary to use tooth-powders or
lotions&mdash;though many prefer to do so. Where
something of the kind is desired, ordinary lime-water
is perhaps as satisfactory as anything
else; peroxide of hydrogen, diluted eight or ten
times with water, to which a pinch or two of
ordinary cooking soda has been added, undoubtedly
aids the cleansing process, and has
the advantage that it leaves a pleasant after-taste
in the mouth. In brushing the teeth care<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
should be taken that every part of the tooth receives
attention, it being not sufficient, as is so
often done, merely to brush the front. It
should be the practice of everyone to have the
teeth looked over at least once a year by a good
dentist, as even where cleansing is diligently
performed decay frequently sets in on their
inner sides.</p>

<p>The utmost care should be taken of the permanent
teeth especially, and as long as it is
possible to prevent it no one should be allowed
to pull them. There can be no doubt that life is
shortened by the early loss of the permanent
teeth in most, if not in all, cases&mdash;not to count
loss in health and happiness that follows their
absence.</p>

<p><i>Clothing,&mdash;Material and Color.</i>&mdash;Clothing
will be considered in this article only as regards
its function of properly protecting the body,
which it does by preventing the escape of heat,
thus keeping the body warm, or, under other
circumstances, by keeping out excessive heat or
cold.</p>

<p>Materials of which clothing is made differ
very greatly in their ability to accomplish the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
object just mentioned, some being comparatively
poor conductors of heat and hence fulfill
the desired function admirably, while others,
for opposite reasons, are of comparatively little
value for this purpose. In general it may be
said that structures of animal origin, such as
wool and silk, are much poorer heat conductors
than those obtained from the vegetable world,
and as a consequence the former are justly held
in much higher esteem as material for clothing
than the latter. It should not be forgotten,
however, that the protective value of a fabric
also depends upon the manner in which it is
woven, since those that are loosely constructed
are much warmer, other things being equal, than
those that are put together more closely; this
depends upon the fact that in the former there
are innumerable small cavities between the
fibers in which air is contained, and as this substance
is a very poor conductor of heat, it follows
that a garment made loosely and containing
many such chambers is warmer than where
the number is less. It may well be the case
that a fabric constructed of a material which
is a poor conductor of heat and closely woven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
may be actually cooler than another composed
of a substance which is a much better conductor
of heat but of a loose texture.</p>

<p>The efficiency of different materials of which
clothing is made also depends upon their
capacity to absorb water. This may be done
in two ways: the water may simply collect between
the fibers, in which case it may be in a
large measure removed by wringing, or it may
be actually absorbed into the substance composing
the fabric, and, as a consequence, the latter,
even though containing much moisture, do
not appear damp. Fabrics made from vegetable
materials, as cotton or linen, have little
power of actually absorbing water, and hence
they become wet on the slightest addition of
moisture, while on the other hand those of
animal origin have the capacity of absorbing
water, and appear dry even after the addition
of this substance in considerable amounts. A
person, therefore, dressed in cotton fabrics will
find after active perspiration has begun that
his clothing quickly becomes moist, while if he
have on woolen garments this will not occur.
It is particularly noteworthy that water is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
gradually removed by evaporation from animal
fabrics, which causes a general cooling without
producing a chill; it is therefore readily understood
that woolen clothing is much to be preferred
where active exercise is being taken.</p>

<p>Color is also of some importance in determining
the value of a fabric for protecting the
body from the sun's heat. Within recent times
we have learned a great deal respecting the
wonderful penetrating power of the invisible
light rays, and we have every reason to believe
that these modify to a very considerable degree
every process going on within the body. The
violet and ultra-violet rays are those that unquestionably
exert most influence, and it has
been suggested that they may be broken up and
rendered innocuous by covering the body with
materials having a reddish-yellow color. It is
not necessary to put these materials on the outside
where they would be conspicuous, but they
may be used as lining for hats and clothing; and
there are good reasons to believe that if their
use were generally adopted suffering and actual
loss of life from overheating would be greatly
reduced, particularly in warm countries.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Work and Rest.</i>&mdash;Very slowly the people of
our country are beginning to realize that it is
quite as necessary to rest as to work, though
unfortunately in some quarters a strenuous life
is urged as being only secondary in importance
to possessing a big family; that there is an
intimate association between the two there can
be no doubt, since the latter beyond peradventure
would entail the former. It has ever been
the habit and misfortune of sages now and then
to desert the field of their own peculiar activities
and to make incursions into unknown regions&mdash;generally
giving advice with a dogmatism
and finality proportionate to their ignorance
of the subject under discussion.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact the average American
works entirely too much, and while he sometimes
accumulates an immense fortune with astounding
rapidity, to his sorrow he often learns
later that he has likewise acquired a damaged
heart, premature thickening of his blood-vessels
or nervous dyspepsia with all of its attendant
evils. Descended as we are in a large measure
from the most vigorous and adventurous Europeans
of the last few centuries, and coming into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
possession of a new world where everything
was to be done, this tendency to overwork is
most natural,&mdash;and for this reason is all the
more to be combated. That we have been able
so successfully to carry the burden for several
generations is indeed remarkable, but there are
not wanting numerous indications that the
strain is beginning to tell. If we do not call a
halt, and devote more time to rest and agreeable
pastimes, disastrous consequences are sure
to follow, and we will become in the course of
time a race of neurasthenics and degenerates.
Attention should likewise be directed to the fact
that men do not develop to the highest point
of mentality who devote their entire time to
work, as leisure is absolutely essential for
thought and the development of all that is best
in man.</p>

<p>Let us then cast aside the shallow and ignorant
preachments of those who do not understand
the subject, and devote a reasonable time
to the reading of good books, to thought, to
the cultivation of the arts and sciences, and to
pleasurable pastimes. In these particulars we
are far behind Europe, and we shall never take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
our place as an intellectual people until we
radically change our method of life. A nation
must dream before becoming great. Let it not
be understood from the foregoing that the
writer would in the slightest degree minimize
the necessity for a reasonable amount of work,
for he thoroughly appreciates that without labor
neither the individual nor the nation itself
could remain sound&mdash;it is only urged that excessive
work is quite as much to be feared as
none at all.</p>

<p><i>Health and Labor.</i>&mdash;As to the number of
hours that should be devoted to labor no rule
can be laid down. It all depends on the age,
physical and mental vigor of the individual, and
likewise, to a considerable degree, on the character
of the work. Occupations requiring intense
mental or physical strain can only be kept
up for short periods of continuous application,
while, on the other hand, quite naturally, those
of a less strenuous nature would permit longer
hours. The young man, in pride of perfect
bodily and mental vigor, too often assumes, because
he has been able in the past to do pretty
much anything that pleased him without ill-effect,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
that he can continue to do the same through
life. No greater mistake could be made.</p>

<p>Anything that has a tendency to undermine
the health, repeated sufficiently often, will ultimately
cause a complete breakdown. How often
do we see the strength and beauty of early manhood
blighted and turned to premature old age
and death as a consequence of disregarding the
warnings that have just been given! How frequently
do we observe young men rejoicing in
the emancipation from home and school and
spurred on by the fatal delusion that while
others might suffer they will not, becoming in
the end the victim of that arch enemy of early
manhood, consumption! Every practicing
doctor has seen this, not once, but hundreds of
times, and in the vast majority of instances
he can say with truth that the frightful result
is a consequence of overwork&mdash;too often associated
with nocturnal dissipation. The man
who works during the day, and devotes his
nights to alcohol and gay company when he
should be sleeping, will assuredly, sooner or
later&mdash;and usually sooner&mdash;suffer the inevitable
consequences.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>To those who live sedentary lives, active out-door
exercise is very essential, but inasmuch as
this little volume is being written for those who
live a saner and more healthful existence, it is
not deemed necessary to discuss here this phase
of the subject.</p>

<p><i>Value of Sleep.</i>&mdash;Closely connected with the
subject just discussed is sleep. Here also we
have no rules, or laws, from which we can clearly
determine the amount required in individual
cases. Overwise philosophers have asserted
that seven hours for a man, eight hours for a
woman, and nine hours for a fool, was the allotted
time for sleep. As a matter of fact, the
necessity for repose varies greatly in different
individuals, some of them requiring less while
others demand more. It is a safe rule to follow
that every man should sleep as long as he
naturally desires, for nature is a much better
mentor than any man could be&mdash;however
learned. The majority of men require at least
eight hours of sleep for the day and night, and
this should be secured if possible at such a time
as will permit it to be undisturbed; hence it is
that man usually prefers to sleep at night, and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
all things considered, it is probably the time
best suited for his repose. We read many
marvelous stories of certain great men who required
little or no sleep. Within recent years
the press has frequently contained articles recounting
the extraordinary fact that a certain
prominent inventor of this country lived daily
on a mere spoonful or so of food, and only slept
a few hours now and then when there was nothing
else particularly to do. Such stories should
be accepted only on absolute proof, as, irrespective
of their utter improbability, one may observe
that they are generally insisted upon in
and out of season with a pertinacity that
would indicate that they were conceived and
are scattered abroad with the sole idea of impressing
the general public with what a marvelous
and unusual person the individual in question
is. There can be no reasonable doubt that
they are merely evidences of childish vanity
and puerile mendacity, and are only referred to
here for the reason that young persons, ignorant
of the laws of health, might attempt to
emulate them, with results that could be but disastrous.
<i>Nothing so preserves youth, health,</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
<i>and good looks as a sufficient amount of sleep,
and it is pre-eminently the secret of long life.</i></p>

<p>Reference will be made in the chapter on the
<a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Hygiene of Infancy</a> to the necessity of children
sleeping as much as is possible. It will do no
harm to say again here that nothing is so essential
for the proper development of the body
as sleep, <i>and that it is absolutely a crime to
awaken a child except under circumstances of
absolute necessity</i>.</p>

<p><i>Precautions in Respect to Eating.</i>&mdash;A sufficient
amount of sleep, and a proper quantity
of digestible and nutritious food, thoroughly
cooked and carefully masticated, are the things
which above all others are most important for
the maintenance of health. In the chapter on
Foods, the nutritive values and digestibility of
the various articles eaten by man will be discussed
with sufficient thoroughness to instruct
the reader as to a wholesome dietary; it is,
therefore, not necessary here to go into the matter
fully, but the subject is so important that a
few general remarks will not be out of place.</p>

<p>Eating should never, so far as is possible, be
hurried. Nothing is more important for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
proper digestion of food than its thorough
mastication, and this can only be accomplished
when sufficient time is allowed for eating. It is
not necessary that this be done to the extreme
advocated by some, but it is certainly of the
highest importance that the food be so
thoroughly chewed that it is reduced to fine
particles, and that it should be so soaked in
saliva that it may be swallowed without the aid
of liquids of any kind.</p>

<p>It is also desirable that food should not be
taken while the individual is tired, so that it is a
good plan where this condition exists for one
to lie down for a short time before eating.</p>

<p>Regularity in eating is likewise of importance,
it being best to take the meals at stated periods;
the consumption of food at irregular hours often
leads to indigestion and is a practice which
should not be indulged in.</p>

<p>It is highly desirable to have food served
under agreeable circumstances, digestion being
accomplished in a much more satisfactory manner
if pleasant conversation be indulged in during
the meal, and if the food be of an appetizing
character. Nothing is of more importance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
in connection with this subject than to have the
food properly prepared. Not only is thorough
cooking important from the standpoint of making
foods digestible, but as is shown in another
part of this volume, grave and sometimes fatal
diseases are contracted by a neglect of this important
procedure.</p>

<p>Fruits, contrary to what is generally thought,
contain but little nourishment, and severely tax
the digestive powers of those who have a tendency
to dyspepsia. When eaten at all, they
should be perfectly ripe and fresh, and should
always be taken after meals rather than before.</p>

<p><i>Drinks,&mdash;Coffee, Tea, Milk, etc.</i>&mdash;Much misconception
exists, among people generally, and
even among the medical profession, concerning
the proper amount of water that should be
drunk. While this substance is unquestionably
the most wholesome of all drinks, there exists
no necessity for taking it in great quantities
at times when the system does not call for it.
It would perhaps be a good rule for all to form
the habit of drinking little while eating, the
reason for which will be explained hereafter.</p>

<p>Coffee is exceedingly popular both on account<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
of its delicious odor and taste when properly
made, and for the reason that it is highly stimulating.
While it is borne by young and vigorous
persons of either sex with apparent impunity,
there frequently comes a time in life
when it can no longer be drunk without ill
effects. As a general rule, dyspeptics do not
bear it well.</p>

<p>Tea, if properly prepared, is a most palatable
beverage, and one that is generally better borne
than coffee. It is more wholesome when taken
without lemon juice, and like coffee it is less
disposed to produce trouble if largely diluted
with milk, or if taken without cream or sugar.</p>

<p>Cocoa and chocolate are often used as substitutes
for tea or coffee, and where they agree
with the individual are perhaps as wholesome
as either. Both, however, contain considerable
quantities of fat, and as they are frequently
prepared with cream, or very rich milk, they
are not as a rule well borne.</p>

<p>While milk might be considered as being almost
as much a food as a drink still the fact
that it is fluid, and that it contains a very large
percentage of water, causes it to be regarded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
as a beverage. When taken slowly&mdash;and this
precaution is particularly necessary where it is
fresh and sweet&mdash;milk is a drink that should
be regarded as being on a par with water. It
contains no injurious substances, but sour milk
should, as a rule, be avoided by dyspeptics.</p>

<p>The cardinal principle in taking beverages of
any kind at mealtime is that they should be
drunk alone after the food has been swallowed,
as when they are taken with the purpose of
softening the latter, mastication is seriously interfered
with and the proper soaking of the
food in the saliva prevented.</p>

<p><i>Alcoholic Beverages.</i>&mdash;Alcoholic drinks are
so fully discussed in a latter part of this book
that here it may merely be stated that they cannot
be regarded as having food-value to any
degree, and so far as the matter is at present
understood, appear to be entirely superfluous,
and even positively injurious. If taken at all,
they should be consumed in extreme moderation,
after meals rather than before. The
young especially should be particularly warned
against the use of all beverages of this class.</p>

<p><i>A Word on &ldquo;Soft Drinks.&rdquo;</i>&mdash;Mention should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
also be made of those drinks commonly sold at
soda-fountains. The vast majority of them
may be taken occasionally without any appreciable
ill effects, but the habitual use of beverages
containing considerable quantities of syrup
is not entirely wholesome. Particularly is this
true where the drink contains stimulating
drugs, such as do some of those most advertised.
Some of them are, if no worse, the equivalent of
a strong cup of coffee, and should, therefore, no
more be taken every hour or two during the day
than a cup of the substance just mentioned. If
their use is persisted in, it is sure to be followed
by indigestion, and in many instances nervous
disorders of even a serious character. The
reader should also be warned against the use of
drinks containing medicine for the relief of pain&mdash;particularly
those that are advertised as remedies
for headache. Practically without exception,
all such drinks contain coal-tar preparations
that greatly depress the heart, and have in
a number of instances been followed by death.
Drugs of this character should be taken with
the utmost circumspection, and only on the prescription
of a competent physician.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Tobacco.</i>&mdash;Tobacco, of all nerve sedatives, is
the most universally used. In moderation it
could not be said that it is followed by any apparent
ill effects in the majority of people, but
if used in excess oftentimes sets up serious disturbances.
It is peculiarly injurious to boys,
and should never be indulged in until manhood
is reached. Some persons seem to possess a
natural immunity to the ill effects of nicotine,
and appear to be able throughout their lives to
chew or smoke tobacco in any amount without
harmful results; such instances are, however,
rare&mdash;its excessive use being usually followed
by symptoms that may be of a serious nature.
Of the two methods of use perhaps smoking is
less open to objection, though it is unquestionably
true that chewing is not so apt to cause disturbances
of the heart. Smoking affects the
stomach, but not to the extent that chewing
does.</p>

<h3>SANITATION IN AND ABOUT THE HOUSE</h3>


<p>The bearing of intelligently located houses
of proper construction on health is not so generally
understood, even by physicians, as the
facts warrant, and, of course, is even less well
recognized by the non-medical public. It is
true that some attention has been given to the
matter of <i>location</i>, but even in this connection
there prevails a woful ignorance among all
classes as to just how the diseases are transmitted
that are most influenced in this way. As
a result of recent advances in medicine it has
been clearly shown that at least some of the
diseases that are most influenced by locality
may be easily avoided, and as a consequence we
find that the views of the modern sanitarians
have necessarily undergone a certain amount
of change in this direction. On the other hand
recognition of the necessity of hygienic <i>construction</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
has not been sufficiently accentuated,&mdash;since
it is possible by proper attention
to the details of building to do away entirely
with at least two of the diseases that have heretofore
been the principal drawbacks to life in
all tropical and sub-tropical countries. Much
importance likewise attaches to houses being
thoroughly ventilated, and to their being sufficiently
roomy to properly accommodate their
inmates. The following table shows the striking
relationship that mortality bears to over-crowding:&mdash;</p>

<tr><td align='left'>Vienna</td><td>55</td><td>47</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Many other statistics could be quoted, but all
follow the general trend of those just given.</p>

<p><i>Choice of Site.</i>&mdash;In our rural districts the inhabitants
have a wide latitude in the matter of
the selection of the location for their houses,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
and it is usually the case that our people are
sufficiently intelligent to make the best use of
their opportunities in this direction. It may,
however, be mentioned that it is generally considered
that building-sites in the neighborhood
of cemeteries are not favorable locations, nor
should houses be erected in the vicinity of a
manufacturing plant that gives off injurious
gases, or obnoxious materials of other kinds.
Inasmuch as we now know that malaria is transmitted
by a certain mosquito, and that by properly
screening the house their attacks may be
avoided, the necessity no longer exists for
avoiding the vicinity of lakes and rivers as
building-sites; such localities being as a rule
pleasant and often picturesque, they would
naturally under ordinary circumstances be selected,
and there now remains no reason why
this may not be done,&mdash;provided that the house
is so constructed that mosquitoes can be effectually
prevented from gaining entrance.</p>

<p>Of much importance is the selection of a
locality where good and pure water can be
easily procured, as otherwise disastrous consequences
are sure to follow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>The soil should be of a light and porous character,
easily permeable by water, and free from
the decomposing remains of excretions of man
or animals. There is much reason for the belief
also that the level of the ground-water
plays a somewhat important part in the salubrity
of any given locality, and it is generally
considered that this should be at least ten feet
below the surface. It is generally thought,
and probably with truth, that those sites are
most healthful which have their location on a
basis of granite, or other rock-foundation; in
such localities there is usually a considerable
slope of the general surface of the ground, with
the result that water rapidly runs off after
rains, and consequently stagnant pools, which
might serve as a breeding place for mosquitoes
and bacteria, do not form. Soils through which
water easily permeates are likewise, as a rule,
healthy, though this depends in a measure upon
whether or not they contain a very considerable
proportion of vegetable matter. Clay foundations
are healthful where there is a considerable
slope to the surface of the ground, but
where this does not exist the soil is damp, owing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
to its impermeability, and often has stagnant
pools upon its surface. Marls and alluvial
soils are not regarded as being wholesome, but
it is not unlikely that their bad reputation is
largely due to the fact that they generally exist
in the neighborhood of rivers and other considerable
bodies of water where mosquitoes are
numerous. There are no reasons going to
show that cultivated lands are unhealthy&mdash;even
where they receive yearly abundant additions
of manure. Where it is necessary to
build in damp localities the site should be thoroughly
drained, and the space upon which the
house is constructed should be carefully covered
with some impermeable cement.</p>

<p><i>Building Materials.</i>&mdash;Of all building materials,
the one most commonly employed in
America is wood. This arises from the fact
that in the past we have had unlimited quantities
of timber from which lumber could be
procured at a price so reasonable that no other
material could ordinarily be considered. That
the wooden house has some advantages cannot
be denied; its walls rapidly cool following the
torrid days that so commonly occur during the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
summer in almost all portions of the United
States, and it is usually well ventilated as a result
of the numerous fissures naturally existing
in its structure.</p>

<p>Next to wood, bricks are most commonly used
for building purposes, and have many advantages,
among which are their handsome effect,
their stability, and their being poor conductors
of heat; the last mentioned is of considerable
importance, since it keeps both heat and frost
from rapidly permeating the interior, and as a
consequence houses constructed of this material
are cooler in summer and warmer in winter.</p>

<p>Other materials occasionally used are concrete,
granite, marble, and sandstone, any of
which, on account of their durable character
and the beauty that they lend to structures
made from them, may be selected for building
purposes, but inasmuch as they are rarely used
in rural districts, a detailed consideration of
their peculiar advantages for building purposes
is not deemed here necessary.</p>

<p>The internal wall-coating of houses deserves
more consideration than is commonly accorded
it, since the dyes used for coloring wall-paper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
and curtains in some instances contain noxious
materials. Chief among those that are dangerous
are the bright green pigments which
commonly contain arsenic as their principal
constituent; where these or other poisonous
substances are employed in interior decorations
the air, wherever the room is kept closed, may
become more or less impregnated with poisonous
gases, and serious consequences to the inmates
may ensue.</p>

<p><i>Screening Indispensable to Health.</i>&mdash;Nothing
is more important in connection with house
construction than having every opening thoroughly
screened. We have learned that both
malaria and yellow fever are transmitted always
by certain kinds of mosquitoes, and it
therefore, becomes a matter of the greatest importance
to effectually prevent the entrance of
these insects. It cannot be too strongly insisted
upon that we absolutely know that the
statement just made is correct, and that avoiding
the diseases referred to becomes as a consequence
entirely a matter of preventing the
entrance of mosquitoes into houses.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="Mosquito" width="90%">

</table></div>

<p>The <i>Anopheles</i> mosquito, which is the one
that transmits malaria, often exists in localities
where the more common varieties do not occur,
and on account of the habits of this insect
their presence is liable to be overlooked. They
seldom attempt to bite during the day, and it
is only rarely the case that they try to do so at
night in a well lighted room;&mdash;particularly
where movement of any kind is going on. During
the day this mosquito remains perfectly
quiet in the dark corners of the house, and is
very fond of resting on cobwebs, presenting,
when doing so, an appearance strikingly similar
to that of fragments of leaves, soot or of
other natural objects that are frequently found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
suspended on such structures. On account of
these peculiarities and for the further reason
that the insect bites mainly just following daybreak,
when the victim is profoundly unconscious
in sleep, its presence often remains undetected,
and as a consequence we occasionally
hear from those who do not take the trouble to
inform themselves that malaria exists in this or
that locality where mosquitoes do not occur.</p>

<p>The yellow-fever mosquito bites for the most
part during the day, but will do so at any time
when there is light. In districts where this
disease occurs it is quite as important to prevent
its entrance as that of the malarial mosquito.
Not only does screening prevent malaria
and yellow fever, but it keeps out flies and
other insects that unquestionably bring with
them the germs of other diseases.</p>

<p>There now remains no doubt that several
affections, notably typhoid fever and dysentery,
are frequently communicated by means of the
common house-fly, which spends its time alternately
on the fecal material around privies or
in other filth, and in our kitchens and dining-rooms;
it is one of the most astounding evidences<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
of the power of habit, in the face of common
sense and ordinary decency, that we have
not long ago taken active steps to rid ourselves
of its disgusting presence. Fortunately in
screens we have a perfect barrier to the entrance
of flies, and no house can be considered
complete without being thoroughly equipped
with these all-necessary appliances.</p>

<p>It is scarcely possible to overestimate the
economy that results from the use of screens;
among the various means employed for conserving
the public health they take first rank,
and undoubtedly insure those who live in houses
to which they have been added an immunity
against the costly effects of disease that could
scarcely be computed. A house would be more
habitable without chairs, beds, or tables than
screens, since in the absence of the former we
may be healthy, though somewhat uncomfortable,
but without the latter serious disorders are
pretty certain, sooner or later, to make their appearance.</p>

<p>It is of considerable importance to use a
screen the mesh of which is sufficiently fine.
Where mosquitoes exist, the screen should be of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
such fineness that at least sixteen, or better
eighteen meshes be in each inch of the gauze.
Where it is absolutely certain that mosquitoes
are not to be feared, the spaces may be somewhat
larger&mdash;but always of such size as will
prevent the entrance of the smallest fly.</p>

<p><i>Air-space Required.</i>&mdash;It is of much importance
from a hygienic standpoint that the rooms
of dwellings should be sufficiently large. The
height should never be less than eight feet, and
the living-room should be made as large as circumstances
will permit. Bed-chambers should
contain at least 1,000 cubic feet of air space for
each adult, with somewhat less for children,
though it should never be forgotten that the
more the better; this means that each person
should have the equivalent of a room which is at
least 10 x 12 x 9 feet.</p>

<p><i>Heating.</i>&mdash;Americans are extravagant in the
matter of heating to a degree that astonishes the
average foreigner, and it is by no means sure
that we do not go to unhygienic extremes in this
direction. It is not, perhaps, true that the excessive
heat itself could be considered as especially
hurtful, but it is too often the case that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
the conditions required to secure the degree of
heat preferred by us are incompatible with
proper ventilation, and hence are to be condemned.
It is generally considered that the
temperature of living-rooms should be somewhere
about 70&deg;F.; for many persons this is
lower than would be entirely comfortable, and
as a consequence our houses in the winter are
frequently kept nearer 80&deg;F. than the figure
just given. The reader should be urged to see
to it that, at whatever temperature his habitation
is kept, a sufficient amount of ventilation be
secured.</p>

<p>There are many different methods of heating,
the most satisfactory of which are by means of
hot water or steam; a modified form of the latter
is the so-called vapor method, which in recent
years has proven extremely satisfactory.
Hot air, supplied by a furnace is also extensively
used, and for the reason that by this
method fresh air from the outside is constantly
brought into the house, it is theoretically to be
commended; practically, however, a considerable
difficulty is experienced in securing an
equable distribution of this heat throughout the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
various parts of the house, and as a consequence
it has not achieved the popularity that
it would otherwise have done.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the installation of plants for
heating by the methods just referred to entails
quite an expense, and for the further reason
that they require coal for satisfactory operating,
they have not been employed in the rural
districts of America to any considerable extent.
The farmer, for the most part, depends on the
old open fireplace where wood is plentiful and
the weather does not become excessively cold,
while in those portions of the country where
the temperatures in winter go very low, the
stove is generally employed. Of the two
methods, the former is much the more hygienic
where it can be used successfully, but over a
greater portion of the United States this cannot
be done owing to the cold winter climate.</p>

<p>The principal objection to the stove lies in
the fact that the heat that comes from it is
very dry, and that where its walls have to be
heated excessively, unpleasant odors are apt
to be generated; the former is usually and ought
always to be obviated by keeping upon the stove<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
a vessel of water, the vapors from which
moisten the atmosphere, and the latter by having
the stove of such size that it will not require
excessive heating in order to warm the room in
which it is placed. Wherever possible the open
fireplace is to be preferred to the stove for the
reason that it very thoroughly ventilates the
room.</p>

<p><i>Ventilation.</i>&mdash;In order that the health of the
inmates may be conserved proper ventilation of
all habitations is essential. However cold the
weather may be, an abundance of fresh air
should be allowed to enter all parts of the house.
In the average wooden dwelling there are so
many cracks that good ventilation is generally
secured without opening doors or windows, but
where the construction does not permit this,
openings for the entrance of air should be left
in the most convenient and suitable places.
Windows may be slightly raised and draughts
prevented by proper screening, or what is even
better, rooms should be so constructed that they
have openings at the top and at the bottom to
allow free ventilation. Openings towards the
upper portion of rooms are especially important<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
in hot weather, as the warm air rises to the
ceiling and escapes only very slowly where such
exits do not exist. Lowering windows from the
top aids materially in allowing the hot air to
escape, but this is not altogether so satisfactory
as having openings higher up on the walls, or
in the ceiling.</p>

<p><i>Disposal of Sewage.</i>&mdash;No problem that confronts
the dweller in the rural district is of
greater importance than the proper disposal of
sewage. It is unfortunately impossible in
most instances for the farmer to have in his
house a system of water-works, and, therefore,
all dish-waters and slops are thrown into the
yard, and a privy is used instead of a modern
water-closet. Where the lay of the land is such
that water readily runs off, or the soil is of a
character that permits rapid absorption, throwing
slops on the ground around the house may
not constitute a danger to the inmates, but nothing
is more certain than that the old fashioned
privy is a dire menace to the health of all those
in its vicinity.</p>

<p>Not only are infectious materials brought
into houses by flies, from fecal matter and other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
excretions, but they are carried away by the
rains and sometimes contaminate sources of
water-supply. It is furthermore extremely
probable that bacteria in particles of dust from
dried fecal material may be carried by the winds
from privies into wells and houses, and as a consequence
diseases may be spread; of perhaps
still more importance&mdash;and certainly of far
greater moment all over the southern portions
of the country&mdash;is the fact that hook-worm disease
and other infections caused by animal parasites
are transmitted from man to man as the
result of our adherence to the old fashioned
privy.</p>

<p>As will be explained in the chapter devoted
to the common communicable diseases, the eggs
of the hook-worm pass from the intestine along
with the feces of those who are victims of this
parasite and reaching the ground, hatch out in
the course of a few days minute hook-worm embryos,
which crawl away and permeate the soil
in the vicinity; later collecting in little pools that
form after rains, or in dew-drops during the
night, they attach themselves to the skin of barefooted
children who come in contact with such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
collections of water, and boring into the body
ultimately, through a circuitous route, reach the
intestines. Here they undergo further development,
and in a short time become mature hook-worms,
which in their turn lay eggs, and the
life cycle begins over again. It is thus seen that
a child having hook-worm disease becomes a
menace, on account of the privy, to its brothers
and sisters, and of course quite commonly receives
back into its own body, worms that had
previously escaped as eggs.</p>

<p>In the same way eggs of the two common tapeworms
pass out with the feces, and the offal
containing them being eaten by hogs in the one
case, or being scattered in the vicinity and taken
in with grass by cows in the other, have their
shells dissolved off as soon as they reach the
stomachs of these animals, and there are liberated
small embryos that bore through the walls
of the stomach and later find their way into the
muscular tissues of these beasts, and there lie
dormant until eaten by man with imperfectly
cooked meat; after being swallowed, the embryo
parasite passes to the intestine and soon becomes
a fully developed tapeworm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>Particular reference at this point should be
directed to the evil effects, which are even still
greater than those that come from the privy,
of permitting children and hired helpers to scatter
their feces indiscriminately in corners of the
yard, the apple-orchard, or in the horse-lot;
under such circumstances, where hook-worm
disease is once introduced, the soil in the course
of a short time becomes thoroughly permeated
with the embryos of this worm, and, as a consequence,
all of the children who play in the infected
area barefooted, as is customary in the
country, are sooner or later infected with these
parasites. It is thus seen that soil-pollution
from fecal material is a most dangerous thing,
and, particularly in the southern portion of the
United States, deserves the most earnest consideration
of everyone. We should see to it that
our children only evacuate their bowels in
properly constructed closets; and it is the duty
of the head of every family to provide such a
place for the accommodation of those who are
dependent on him.</p>

<p><i>Proper Construction of Out-door Privies.</i>&mdash;The
most practical and generally satisfactory<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
device heretofore invented for the disposal of
the sewage of communities unprovided with
water-works is what is known as the Rochdale,
or dry-closet, system. By this system a privy,
at a distance from the dwelling, is constructed
in the ordinary manner, with the exception that
instead of being open at the back it is tightly
closed. In the space beneath the seat receptacles
are placed for receiving the urine and feces.
These may consist of pails of wood or better
of galvanized iron; or a single box occupying the
whole space. If wooden receptacles are used,
they should be thoroughly coated on the inside
with tar, to prevent both leakage and the soaking
of the liquids into the wood. One such
structure, which the writer knows has been
wholly satisfactory has a brick foundation with
walls two feet high around the front and sides,
within which rests a shallow tarred box. It ensures
perfect cleanliness.</p>

<p>In any case this space under the seat is
tightly closed, being guarded by doors that open
outward, through which the pails or box may be
introduced and removed for emptying.</p>

<p>Each privy contains a box in which is placed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
either wood ashes or dry powdered earth, with
a small shovel by which a sufficient quantity of
the dust to cover the deposit is thrown into the
pail after each evacuation. It is remarkable
how completely this shovelful of earth or ashes
destroys all disagreeable smell. The privy
should be provided with at least two opposite
windows, both of which should be thoroughly
screened. The entrance should have a door that
is closed with a spring, so that it cannot be
carelessly or accidentally left open when vacant.
At intervals the pails containing the
feces are removed, and the contents are carried
to a distance and buried.</p>

<p>Another plan that is quite satisfactory where
iron pails are used, is to place a quantity of
water in the vessels for receiving the feces, and
then to pour in a small quantity of kerosene;
the latter substance forms a layer over the water
that keeps out flies, and does away largely with
the disagreeable odors that are likely to emanate.</p>

<p>If any contagious disease exists among those
who use such a closet, the fecal material should
be carefully sterilized before being removed, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
by means of corrosive sublimate, carbolic acid,
chlorinated lime, or any one of the many commercial
disinfectants containing crysylic acid,
all of which may be obtained at any drug store.
If carbolic acid or other liquid antiseptics be
used the amount by volume should be equal to
about five per cent. of the material to be treated;
the proportion of corrosive sublimate should
be at least 1 to 1,000 where this disinfectant
is used. Along with whatever antiseptic is
chosen, water should be added in sufficient quantity
to permit the whole to be rendered semi-fluid,
and the mixture should then be thoroughly
stirred, and the chemical left to act for some
hours before emptying the receptacle. By far
the most satisfactory method of sterilizing infected
material, however, is by boiling, since
disease-germs are killed by such a temperature
in a few moments. Where iron receptacles are
used, therefore, the simplest method is to set
them upon an open fire in the yard for a little
while.</p>

<p>A privy constructed after the manner just described
possesses some advantages even over
the regulation water-closets that are used in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
cities, since they are cheaper in original cost,
require less repairs, and are uninjured by a
freezing temperature. The amount of care required
to keep them in proper condition is not
excessive, and they are so infinitely superior
from a hygienic standpoint to the old-time privy
that no sort of comparison is possible.</p>

<p>It should always be remembered that the
principal advantages of this closet are that
where it is used we are able to collect all of
the evacuations, which may then be properly
deodorized with soil or ashes, and that it may
then be finally disposed of in such a way that
it cannot be reached by hogs or other animals;
of very great importance also is the screening
of the closet, since only in this way is it possible
to prevent flies from gaining entrance to
the fecal material in the receiving pails.</p>

<p><i>Water supply.</i><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>&mdash;In the location of houses
and schools an eye should always be had to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
selecting a site where it is possible to obtain
good, pure water. To those fortunate dwellers
in the mountainous regions of our country this
is usually a matter of little difficulty, since it
is always possible to find a location in the
neighborhood of which the purest spring water
may be obtained. In less favored regions the
well becomes the main reliance, while cisterns
are used in some portions of our country, in
which water is collected during the rainy
seasons of the year. Of the two, the former is
undoubtedly to be preferred, provided a pump
be used instead of the old fashioned bucket.
The writer is strongly of the opinion that a very
large proportion of the contamination to which
sources of water-supply are subject comes from
the bucket being drunk from or handled by persons
with contagious diseases, or from germs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
being blown into the well with dust, or carried
in by means of insects and small animals. It
is inconceivable that any appreciable amount of
contamination from the surface can reach the
underground streams that supply wells in localities
that are thinly populated, though it is
unquestionably true that a well might be infected
as a result of the entrance of surface-water
where its top is not properly protected.
On the other hand we have in an open well or
cistern every facility afforded for the entrance
of bacteria.</p>

<p>It is unquestionably of the utmost importance
that wells be carefully covered over, and every
precaution should be taken to prevent surface-water
leaking into them around their edges.
In order to comply with these conditions a
pump is essential, since it is the only means by
which water can be brought to the surface without
exposing the contents of the well to contamination.
It is likewise of the first importance
to have the walls of the well curbed to a sufficient
depth to prevent the possibility of seepage
from the surface. It is, of course, also
quite necessary that the well be of sufficient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
depth&mdash;the lower we go the more likely are we
to secure a perfectly pure water. In regions
where the water rises to within eight or ten
feet, or less, of the surface, the possibility of
the well being contaminated during the rainy
season by seepage is considerably increased,
and the waters of such wells should be used
only after analyses have shown that they are
pure; where this cannot be done, the water
should be boiled before being drunk. Of
course, the possibilities of contamination are
greatly increased if the locality be thickly inhabited.</p>

<p>As has been before remarked, cisterns are
more liable to contamination from the air than
are wells, chiefly owing to the fact that they are
supplied by water that is conducted into them
by gutters from the tops of houses. There is
no question that during the dry seasons dust
containing many kinds of bacteria is deposited
all over the tops of houses and remains there
until washed away by the rains. While it is
true that the sunlight quickly kills most germs
that produce disease a certain number of them
would inevitably escape, and having gained entrance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
to a cistern, would be likely to multiply
and later cause trouble. It is thus seen that
however pure the rain-water may originally
have been&mdash;and it is among the purest of all
waters&mdash;it is likely to become contaminated in
the process of collection, and may ultimately in
this way become the source of disease. Where
any doubt exists as to the purity of such water
it should be boiled before use.</p>

<p>Surface-streams also occasionally supply
drinking-water in rural districts, and while the
use of such waters may not always be attended
by danger, their contamination by disease-producing
germs is much more to be feared than
when they are derived from wells or springs;
where streams arise from and keep their course
through uninhabited districts the probabilities
are strong that their waters are pure and fit
for use, but where they run through cultivated
fields, and particularly where they pass in the
neighborhood of houses, their waters should
never be looked upon as being drinkable,&mdash;except
after being boiled or properly filtered. Inasmuch
as adequate filtration is exceedingly
difficult to carry out, and requires a somewhat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
extensive and costly plant, this is, as a rule, not
feasible for the dweller in country districts, and
boiling, therefore, remains the only satisfactory
method of rendering the water fit for use where
doubt exists as to its purity.</p>

<p><i>Location of Pens and Stables for Animals.</i>&mdash;Animals
should always be housed at some little
distance from the dwelling. While it is
true that man does not often contract directly
diseases from hogs, sheep, horses and cattle,
there are some maladies of a most serious character
that come to us in this way, and we
should, therefore, always guard against their
occurrence by removing ourselves as far as is
possible from sources of possible infection.
The matter also has an &aelig;sthetic side, as odors
of a disagreeable character may prove very
annoying where animals are kept too close to
the house. It is likewise of importance that
stables should be, if possible, on lower ground
than the dwelling, since during rains materials
from their dung may be washed around and
under the house, and may possibly gain access
to the well.</p>

<p>Every care should be taken to keep hog-pens<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
and stables clean, since otherwise very foul
smells are engendered that oftentimes find their
way to neighboring houses. There is also a
suspicion that some of the germs that produce
disease find the conditions suitable for their
stables and pig-sties.</p>

<p>In this connection it might be well to warn
those unacquainted with the subject against the
<i>all too common practice</i> of close association
with dogs, since it is well established that in
addition to hydrophobia they may transmit,
while apparently in perfect health, maladies of
a deadly character to the human being. It cannot
be too often emphasized that the less intimate
our association with the lower animals is,
the greater the likelihood of our escaping many
serious diseases.</p>

Thousands of men living in rural parts of the United States

<h3>HYGIENE OF INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD</h3>


<p>No characteristic of the Caucasian mind is
more marked, and none more universally affects
his actions than a constant, gnawing suspicion
that the things going on around him are not being
done in the proper way, and consequently an
irrepressible desire to experiment, and if possible,
to change everything. Such a spirit is
unquestionably the basis of what we call progress,
and, in so far as it conduces to the health
and happiness of mankind, is entitled to our
most hearty commendation. On the other
hand, it cannot be denied that too often we endeavor
to bring about changes with but an imperfect
understanding of the basic principles
at issue, and naturally, under such circumstances,
our efforts are crowned with anything
but success. In other words, an enlightened investigation
of the whys and wherefores of any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
existing state of affairs may and often does,
lead to improvement, while, on the other hand,
ignorant meddling is likely to be followed by
disastrous consequences.</p>

<p>Nowhere do we see the bad results of false
conceptions more marked than in our treatment
of infants and children.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Particularly do young infants suffer in this way,
as they are pounced upon as soon as they enter the
world by every old &ldquo;granny&rdquo; and negro &ldquo;mammy&rdquo;
in the neighborhood, and plied with abominable concoctions
that would be productive of homicide if we
were to attempt forcibly to administer them to grown
men, and whose only effect on the defenseless little
sufferer is to cause colic and indigestion. Many times
has the writer seen a wee, tiny little mortal, who was
too young and weak to even protest, bundled up with
a mountain of flannels in the hottest weather of
July and August. True to the superstition that the
warmer we kept an infant the better, too frequently
we see them confined to hot stuffy rooms when they
should be out in the sunshine, or under the trees.
Instead of being allowed to gain health and strength
in the forests, which are the schoolhouses of nature,
the miserable little wretch is later sent to a public
school as soon as he or she can be trusted to go
alone on the streets, and the tiny victim too frequently
contracts diphtheria, scarlet fever, whooping-cough,
measles, or some other disease as a reward of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>merit. Truly we see to it that the helpless innocents
early realize the truth of the melancholy and hopeless
biblical lament that &ldquo;man's days here are few
and full of trouble.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>We should rear our children with as little interference
as possible, allowing them the utmost
freedom compatible with their safety, and
permitting them to do those things that nature
and instinct demand. Above all let them sleep
as much and as long as they will, insist that
they live in the open air, and encourage them
in every possible way to perfect their physical
education by those active amusements that they
instinctively prefer. After they have established
a sound and rugged constitution ample
time will be left for them to develop mentally.</p>

<p><i>Feeding of Nursing Infants.</i>&mdash;The most important
thing in connection with the feeding of
infants is to always remember that nature has
provided in their mother's milk, when sufficiently
abundant and normal in quality, everything
in the way of food and drink that they
require. During the three days that usually
intervene between birth and the coming of the
milk in the mother's breast, infants may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
given from time to time small quantities of
pure water, but under no circumstances should
anything else be allowed. During this period
the child may be put to the breast four or five
times in the twenty-four hours, for, while it
gets but little in the way of nourishment, there
is even at this time a watery fluid secreted in
the breast that goes far towards supplying
everything that the infant needs for the time
being.</p>

<p>A child should never nurse longer than
twenty minutes at one time. It is likewise of
importance that the time of nursing be strictly
regulated.</p>

<p>Particularly during the first year it is of the
utmost importance to watch with an intelligent
eye the growth and development of the child.
Where the milk agrees with it it has a good
color and gains regularly in weight; it cries
but little, and is good natured, and thoroughly
contented. Should it, on the other hand, lose
weight, appear fretful and listless, and sleep
badly, there is something wrong, and the mother
should at once have her milk examined by a
competent physician.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>In case the mother does not give sufficient
nourishment there is no objection to partially
feeding the infant on modified cow's milk&mdash;the
method of the preparation of which will be considered
later on.</p>

<p>Where colic occurs it generally means that
the infant is getting a diet too rich in albuminous
foods, which should be corrected by advising
the mother to take an abundance of out-door
exercise, and to avoid all causes of worry
so far as is possible.</p>

<p>Vomiting freely is a very common occurrence
in small children, and is usually the result
of too much food being taken at a time. It
also occurs, particularly some time after feeding,
as a result of indigestion, which is frequently
the consequence of the milk being too
rich in fats. Wherever an infant shows signs
of trouble it is well to advise the mother to use
a diet less rich in meats, and to caution her
against over-eating.</p>

<p>Children should be weaned at the end of their
first year. This had best be brought about
gradually, by, in the beginning, feeding the
child once daily, and then gradually increasing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
the frequency, at the same time proportionately
leaving off the nursing. Where children are
not thriving, it is often a good practice to wean
earlier, in which case modified cow's milk, taken
from a bottle, must be substituted.</p>

<p><i>Artificial Feeding.</i>&mdash;While it is true that
children often thrive for a time on the various
baby-foods with which the market is so abundantly
supplied, it is, nevertheless, the case
that where fed in this way they are very apt to
develop rickets or scurvy, and not uncommonly
show evidences of bad nutrition in loss of
weight and strength, becoming peevish and
fretful, and sleeping badly.</p>

<p>Much better than any of the artificial foods
is properly modified cow's milk, which, with
care, may be prepared in such a manner as
to take the place of mother's milk in the vast
majority of instances. In order, however, that
this be successfully carried out, much care and
attention is necessary.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>At this point it is well to stress the fact that the
mother's milk differs from that of the cow in some
quite important particulars, and it is only by intelligently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
taking these differences into consideration
that it is possible for us to prepare an artificial food
that will be satisfactory. Principal among these differences
are that cow's milk contains three times as
much albuminous material as that of the human being,
and that it is less rich by about half in milk-sugar;
furthermore, the former is acid in reaction,
while the latter is neutral, or faintly alkaline. It
will be seen, then, that in order to prepare a modified
cow's milk that will approximate that of the human
being it is necessary to dilute it with water sufficiently
to cause the albumin to approach in proportion
that of mother's milk, and at the same time
some alkali must be added to neutralize the excessive
acidity. Modified milk prepared, however, from the
whole cow's milk, would contain much less fat than
is desirable, so that we must use in making it the
upper third of the whole milk after it has been allowed
to remain undisturbed for a number of hours;
in other words, in making modified cow's milk we
use a large proportion of the cream, with a less
amount of the other constituents.</p>

<p>The following table for calculating the proper proportion
of milk to be used at the various periods of
the infant's life may be recommended, as it gives
quite as satisfactory results as those that are more
elaborate; it also gives the frequency of feeding and
the proper amounts that should be used. The table
was devised by Dr. C. E. Boynton, of Atlanta,
Georgia.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In making calculations from this table it is assumed
that the milk from the upper third of the
bottle, after it has been allowed to sit for at least
four hours, contains 10% of fat, and this is therefore
called 10% milk. The calculation is made as
follows:&mdash;10% milk is to the fat percentage desired,
as the amount which we wish to make up is to X.
For example, if we wish to prepare twenty ounces
of milk for an infant two months old, we will note
by referring to the table that 3% is the amount of
fat that is desirable for a milk for a child of this
age, and the formula will be constructed as follows:&mdash;</p>

<center><pre>
10:3::20:X.   X = 60/10.   X = 6.
</pre></center>

<p>Six ounces is then the amount of 10% milk that
must be used for making twenty ounces of modified
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>milk,&mdash;this being mixed with one ounce of lime-water
and thirteen ounces of boiled water. It should never
be forgotten that while milk modified by the foregoing
formula is suitable for most children, it is by
no means always satisfactory, and we may, therefore,
be compelled to do a considerable amount of experimenting
in some cases before arriving at the correct
formula.</p>

<p>Suppose the infant is twelve months old, we would
get according to the rules just stated the following
equation:&mdash;</p>

<center><pre>
10:4::20:X.   X = 80/10.   X = 8.
</pre></center>

<p>Eight ounces would then be the amount of milk
required for preparing twenty ounces of modified
milk for an infant of this age.</p>

<p>In preparing modified milk according to the formulas
just given, it must be remembered that in all
instances only that portion is to be used which collects
in the upper third of a bottle of milk that has
been allowed to sit undisturbed in a refrigerator for
at least four hours. The lime-water is for the purpose
of correcting the acidity of the milk.</p>

<p>It is of much importance to select the milk from
a healthy cow in all instances where it is to be fed
to infants, and where possible, it should be examined
by a competent laboratory man in order to determine
if it answers the proper requirements. The writer
has often seen milk from apparently healthy cows,
which seemed in every way good, that showed on
microscopic examination pus cells and a harmful
germ (streptococcus).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>It is not desirable to have a milk for this purpose
that is too rich in fats, and for this reason a
cow of the ordinary mixed breed is more satisfactory
than the blooded Jerseys or Alderneys.</p>

<p>Not only is it essential to get the proper kind of
milk, but the utmost care is necessary in handling
it. It should, of course, be as free as possible from
every source of contamination, and should be strained
thoroughly as soon as milked. It should then be bottled,
and chilled at once by being placed in cold
water, and after being properly sealed, should be
placed in a refrigerator at a temperature of about
50&deg;F., where it should remain undisturbed for four
hours before the top portion is skimmed off for making
the modified milk.</p>

<p>After the modified milk has been prepared it
should be returned to the refrigerator, where it
should be kept until required for feeding. It is best
not to use milk that has been in the refrigerator
longer than twenty-four hours, or at most forty-eight
hours, and then only if kept at a proper temperature.
The modified milk should be poured directly from
the receptacle in which it is kept into the feeding-bottle,
and the latter should then be placed in warm
water until its content is milk-warm, at which time
it is ready to be given to the child.</p></div>

<p>It is highly necessary in feeding infants by
the bottle to remember that cleanliness in
everything connected with the process only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
makes success possible, and in no particular
does this apply with greater force than in connection
with the proper care of the bottle and
nipple. In every case immediately after use
they should both be put in water, which should
then be brought to a boiling temperature, and
both should then be kept in a saturated solution
of boric acid. The nipple, after being
placed on the bottle, should not come in contact
with anything but the infant's mouth. Bottles
that have no neck are much to be preferred to
others, as they can be readily cleansed. There
is on the market at the present time a bottle
called the &ldquo;Hygeia,&rdquo; which possesses the necessary
qualifications in a perfectly satisfactory
way.</p>

<p>When children who have nursed at the
mother's breast reach the age of weaning it is
of importance to remember that they cannot
eat without digestive disturbances the modified
cow's milk of a strength that would otherwise
correspond to their age; they should invariably
under such circumstances begin with a milk
prepared by the formula used for a child
several months younger, after which the proportion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
of milk may be gradually increased
until it is used in a pure state.</p>

<p>During very warm weather it is well to reduce
the amount of fat by using the whole milk
instead of the top portions, as heretofore described.
The same precaution should be followed
where children have acute diseases, and
the total quantity taken should be less than
under ordinary circumstances. Where infants
have acute indigestion, accompanied by vomiting
and diarrh&#339;a, all milk should be for the
time withheld,&mdash;boiled water being substituted;
some hours later barley water may be given,
but no milk for at least twenty-four hours.
Where children have loss of appetite, it is well
to give less cream, and the intervals between
food should be increased.</p>

<p><i>Sterilized (Pasteurized) Milk.</i>&mdash;During epidemics
of dysentery, diarrh&#339;a, typhoid fever,
scarlet fever, and diphtheria, as well as in those
instances where it is suspected that the cow is
not healthy, or where the milk has to be kept
for considerable periods of time, it is well to
sterilize it by heating. The most effective
method of accomplishing this is by boiling the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
milk for an hour or so, but inasmuch as it is believed
to be then not quite so wholesome as
when less heat is employed, a process known as
<i>pasteurization</i> is frequently used; this consists
in heating the milk for thirty minutes to from
155&deg; to 160&deg;F.,&mdash;such temperatures killing all
of the ordinary germs, but not altering the milk
so completely as when it is boiled.</p>

<p><i>Peptonized Milk.</i>&mdash;It now and then happens
that children fail to thrive where all of the precautions
heretofore referred to have been
strictly adhered to, and under such circumstances
good results are frequently secured by
subjecting the milk to a process known as <i>peptonization</i>.
This consists in the addition of a
digestive ferment, obtained from the pancreas
of lower animals, together with ordinary cooking-soda.
In carrying out the process the milk,
whether whole or modified, is placed in a clean
bottle, and the peptonizing powder added after
having been rubbed up with a teaspoonful of
milk. The container is then placed in a pitcher
of water at a temperature of 110&deg;F., which is
about as warm as the hand can bear comfortably,
and is here left for from ten to twenty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
minutes if only partial peptonization is desired,
or for a couple of hours should it be
wished to complete the process. The peptonized
milk may be prepared at each feeding, or
the whole amount for the day may be made at
one time in the morning; in the latter case,
where it is desired to have the milk only partially
peptonized, the ferment should be destroyed
by boiling after it has been allowed
to act for from ten to twenty minutes.</p>

<p><i>Feeding after the First Year.</i>&mdash;As the infant
is weaned other food should be gradually
added; this should still consist largely of milk,
to which some time later may be added gruels
prepared from well-cooked oats or barley, beef-juice,
or the white of an egg slightly cooked.
The various broths may also be allowed.
Children relish very much all fruit-juices, and
they may be given in moderation without harm,
and even with benefit in many cases. As the
child grows older, the various cereals should
form a greater and greater proportion of its
diet, but due care should be exercised in always
seeing to it that they are thoroughly cooked;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
in order to be digestible for children such substances
should be cooked at least three or four
hours before eaten.</p>

<p><i>General Hygiene of Infant Life.</i>&mdash;In order
for children to be healthy, the greatest regularity
is necessary in their habits. They
should arise at a certain hour in the morning
and go to bed at a fixed time at night. Their
clothing should be loose, and not too tight fitting,
and should at all times correspond to the
state of the weather. Nothing is more common,
and nothing produces irritability, loss of
sleep, and even serious general disturbances
in infants, more frequently than too much clothing.
It is generally customary to use from the
time of birth and during the period of infancy
a flannel band around the child's abdomen.
Just how this acts is not clear, but there seems
good reason for the belief that in some unexplained
way the practice has the effect of
warding off intestinal disturbances, and is,
therefore, to be recommended.</p>

<p>Napkins should be changed when soiled, and
then should be immediately placed in water,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
in which they should remain until washed out;
under no circumstances should they be left lying
around the nursery.</p>

<p>When the weather permits, the child should
be kept as much out-of-doors as is possible.
For the first few days of the infant's life, particularly
if the weather be cool, it should, of
course, be kept indoors, but even then free access
of air should be allowed. There is no objection
whatever to the infant sleeping out-of-doors&mdash;in
fact, where this is feasible, it generally
shows improvement as soon as the practice
is commenced. When out-of-doors, it is of
course necessary to see that the sun does not
shine directly into the infant's face, and wetting
should, of course, be avoided; also the hood
of the carriage should be arranged to prevent
strong winds from blowing on the child.</p>

<p>The nursery should be well aired, a window
being left up at night except during severe
weather.</p>

<p><i>Sleep.</i>&mdash;Nothing is more important for the
proper development of a child than for it to
have an abundance of sleep. During the first
few months of its life it sleeps practically all of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
the time&mdash;the period becoming gradually lessened
as it grows older. Infants should be suffered
to sleep just as much as is possible, it
being not only unjustifiable but absolutely
criminal to interfere with them in this particular
in the slightest degree. Not only is it
necessary that infants have all the sleep that
they desire, but it is true throughout childhood,
a fact to which many foolish parents
seem utterly oblivious. How often do we see
a child scarcely more than an infant aroused
in the morning and sent off to school, and how
frequently do we hear misguided parents boast
of their inflexible rules in enforcing such evil
practices. Truly man comes hard by the
knowledge that nature is much wiser than he,
and the vast majority never learn the fact at
all.</p>

<p>As soon as the child is able to crawl, it should
be placed on a clean quilt or blanket on the
floor, and allowed to move about to its heart's
content. When it is able to walk, allow it to
run about and play to its full capacity&mdash;as in
such exercises consists the great school of its
physical being, the school upon which will depend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
its strength and health in after life. Allow
the child to keep up his play as long as he
has any inclination to do so, and never be so
foolish as to confine him in the house when he
wishes to be out under the blue heavens, for
here only will it be possible for him or her to
develop into a real man or woman. Allow this
to go on until the child of its own accord comes
and asks to be taught other things, for not
until then is its outside education nearing completion,
and not until then is it possible for him
to take interest in and learn things connected
with books. No boy should ever be sent to
school before he is twelve or fourteen years of
age; girls, on account of their maturing earlier,
may begin a couple of years sooner.</p>

<p>The whole science and art of properly raising
children consists in feeding them good
clean food in proper amounts, in never allowing
them to be awakened, and in permitting
them to play in the open air to their hearts' content.</p>

<p><i>Teething.</i>&mdash;Teething is a subject which has
at all times interested both doctor and layman,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
and in its supposed relation to all kinds of
disorders of infancy has undoubtedly exercised
an influence over the popular imagination out
of all proportion to its real importance. Too
often it has happened that this perfectly
normal, and usually by no means serious, process,
has been held responsible for grave diseases
in children&mdash;diseases which in reality
were the consequence of neglect and mismanagement
in the far more serious matters of food,
sleep, out-of-door exercises, and general hygiene.
It cannot, however, be denied&mdash;particularly
in respect to nervous children&mdash;that
teething appears occasionally to induce unpleasant
disturbances, such as fretfulness, broken
sleep, digestive disorders, and occasionally
fever; as a rule such symptoms persist only for
a few days, if the infant be properly looked
after. The treatment should consist in lancing
the gums should they become much swollen,
and the withholding of the usual amount of
food, particularly where intestinal disturbances
occur. The ages at which the teeth usually
come are as follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bowel Diseases.</i>&mdash;Digestive disturbances,
accompanied by diarrh&#339;a, are the bane of infancy,
and are responsible for a very large
part of the frightful mortality among babies.
The subject, therefore, is one of tremendous importance,
but is so complicated that the limits
of this little volume will only permit its being
touched upon.</p>

<p>As already mentioned, indigestion accompanied
by looseness of the bowels may be and
often is the result of milk being used from diseased
cows, or it may be the consequence of such
carelessness in handling it that disease-producing
bacteria are later allowed to contaminate
it. It should also never be forgotten that where
children are eating artificially prepared food
improper mixing of the different components
may result in serious disturbances, and we
should, therefore, exercise the utmost care always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
in seeing to it that the food is prepared
strictly according to the table which has already
been given&mdash;not forgetting that in a certain
number of instances we can go by no rule,
and will have to experiment until we ascertain
the proper proportion of the ingredients.</p>

<p>After a diarrh&#339;a begins we should at once
reduce the quantity of fat in the milk that is
being given to the infant, and if the trouble be
at all severe it is best to take it off of all food
for twenty-four hours, and substitute boiled
water or barley-water. As soon as the trouble
is checked we may then begin to feed cautiously
with largely diluted milk, and, gradually increasing
its strength, in the course of a few
days return to the food that was being given
before the disturbance occurred. A dose of
calomel or castor oil in the beginning of diarrh&#339;al
troubles often has a very salutary effect;
the parent should not hesitate to administer
this if a doctor is not at hand.</p>

<p>In warm climates during the time of teething
children very commonly develop chronic diarrh&#339;al
conditions which often end fatally;
wherever possible the parent should under such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
circumstances at once remove the little sufferer
to a colder climate where recovery is generally
rapid and complete. Even the most careful
nursing under the most competent physician is
often fruitless in combating disorders of this
character as long as the infant remains in a
warm climate.</p>

<p><i>Colic.</i>&mdash;Colic is always due to indigestion,
and is the result of the food undergoing fermentative
changes, with the production of
gases. This goes on even under normal conditions
to a certain extent, but when it is excessive
the intestines become greatly distended,
and pain of a severe or even agonizing character
is produced.</p>

<p>In the treatment of this condition warm applications
should be made to the abdomen, and
as quickly as possible an enema (injection),
consisting of a few ounces of warm solution
of salt water should be given; the salt should
be in the proportion of a level teaspoonful to
the quart of water. Parents will find the little
ear syringe, which may be purchased at any
drug store, a most satisfactory instrument for
giving enemas to infants, as they do not hold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
too much, and being soft, are incapable of tearing
the delicate tissues of the child. It is of
the utmost importance to remember that the
salt solution should be tepid, yet not sufficiently
hot to scald the infant. As the water when
given in this way is expelled very quickly the
enemas may be repeated any number of times
desired.</p>

<p>Where these measures fail, a physician should
be sent for at once, but in the meantime if
it be evident that the infant is suffering very
much, a small dose of paregoric may be given;
it should not however be forgotten that opiates
are exceedingly hurtful to nervous children, and
that soothing syrups and other mixtures containing
drugs of this class should be avoided.</p>

<p><i>Constipation.</i>&mdash;Constipation among very
young children generally passes off as the food
becomes richer, but should it occur at a later
time, the trouble may be more difficult
to remedy. Of first importance is having the
bowels of the infant move at a certain time each
day, which may be quickly accomplished in
many little children by placing them upon a
small chamber daily at a given hour; usually the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
baby very quickly learns what this procedure
means, and in this way a regular habit is established
which is of the utmost value to the
child throughout its infancy, and every effort,
therefore, should be made to bring it about as
quickly as possible.</p>

<p>The addition of malted milk or Mellin's Food
may also have the effect of diminishing constipation;&mdash;the
result being brought about by the
maltose contained in these preparations. The
same thing may be accomplished by substituting
for a part of the milk sugar in the baby's
food a similar quantity of maltose. Milk of
magnesia may be used in preparing the baby's
food in the place of lime-water, with the result
oftentimes of relieving a tendency to constipation.</p>

<p><i>Croup.</i>&mdash;By croup is meant a spasmodic condition
which usually affects children at night,
and is in no way to be confounded with that
really dangerous disease, membranous croup,
or diphtheria, to which so many children fall
victims.</p>

<p>Spasmodic croup is a condition which has as
its basis digestive disturbances, and is almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
always relieved as soon as the stomach is
emptied. Vomiting may be brought about by
making the child swallow a small quantity of
mustard stirred up in water, or by the use of
ipecac. Such severe and extremely unpleasant
remedies are rarely necessary, however, since
the disease may be in almost all instances at
once relieved by placing around the victim's
throat a cloth wrung out of cold water, which
may itself be covered by a dry bandage to prevent
the bed from getting wet. Children will
usually go to sleep in a few minutes after the
cold cloth is applied, and suffer no ill consequences
as a result of its remaining around
their throats throughout the night. Where the
croup is very severe the little sufferer's feet
may be placed in hot water, in addition to the
cold cloth around the neck&mdash;the combination
practically always resulting in the rapid relief
of the unpleasant symptoms.</p>

<p>Great care should be exercised in the diet of
children who are subject to croup, as by intelligent
supervision the tendency to this very annoying
trouble may be in a short time entirely
overcome.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Nervousness.</i>&mdash;Children of neurotic parents,
particularly where they are reared in cities, are
exceedingly prone to nervousness in one form
or another. The condition is undoubtedly often
due to heredity, but may be induced in otherwise
healthy children by unhygienic surroundings
and improper food. Infants exhibiting
symptoms that indicate trouble of this kind
should not be played with, and every care
should be exercised to so direct their lives that
the trouble may be gradually overcome. In all
cases where nervousness persists an intelligent
physician should be consulted.</p>

<p><i>Vaccination.</i>&mdash;The only safe method that we
possess of preventing small-pox is by means of
vaccination. Its great value has been so
thoroughly tested that the writer does not deem
it necessary to go into a discussion as to its
merits. A child should be vaccinated in at
least three places during its early infancy,&mdash;there
being no danger in doing the operation
immediately after birth. Persons ignorant of
aseptic surgery should not do this operation,
but should always call in the services of some
person prepared to do the work in a cleanly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
manner. Either the leg or the arm may be
selected; and children should be revaccinated
whenever small-pox breaks out in the community.</p>

<p><i>Kissing Babies to be Avoided.</i>&mdash;Kissing infants
in the mouth is a very bad practice, as in
this way disease may be quite innocently conveyed
to them. The public should be taught to
understand that it is not infrequently the case
that bacteria may be present in the mouths of
individuals who are quite immune to their ill
effects, and who are, therefore, perfectly well,
but who may, by conveying them to others, particularly
children, induce in them serious disease.
When caressed in this way at all children
should be kissed upon their necks or feet, and
never in their mouths or on their hands.</p>

<p><i>Juvenile Contagious Diseases.</i>&mdash;Children are
peculiarly prone to a class of highly contagious
diseases, the exact nature of which is not
yet understood, and we possess therefore little
knowledge as to the proper means of preventing
their spread. Practically all that is known
about them is that they are conveyed by contact,
or even by the air, particularly where a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
child suffering from one of them is placed in a
confined place with another who is susceptible;
these diseases likewise may be carried by means
of clothing and other articles that have been
in close contact with a child suffering with any
of them. The lesson of importance to be
learned, therefore, is that if we wish our children
to escape maladies of this class we should
not permit their indiscriminate association with
others. As these diseases cease to be a serious
menace after children have passed through
their earlier years it does not at a later time
matter so much as to whether they are exposed
to them or not. As a general thing children
develop these affections in from ten to fifteen
days after having been exposed, though one of
the most severe of them, scarlet fever, may
make its appearance as early as twenty-four
hours after it is contracted. These diseases
are usually ushered in by a severe headache,
pains in the head, back, and limbs, high fever,
and oftentimes a chill. As soon as a child develops
such symptoms the advice of a competent
medical man should be at once sought, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
the little sufferer should be at once completely
isolated.</p>

<p>In concluding, the writer would particularly
exhort parents to obey to the letter the instructions
of their physicians, and never under
any circumstances to dose their helpless off-spring
with patent or proprietary medicines,
which contain no man knows what, and which
unquestionably are often highly injurious, especially

<h3>PROPER EATING&mdash;THE SECRET OF<br />
GOOD HEALTH</h3>


<p>Very slowly the world is awakening to the
fact that no agencies play such an important
part in the preservation of health as the consumption
of reasonable quantities of well-cooked
and properly selected food, and the habitual
taking of wholesome drinks. On all
sides the observant medical man sees constant
and reckless disregard of the simplest and
most fundamental laws governing this subject.
Nothing is more common than to hear of men in
the prime of life being seized with what is
called a &ldquo;nervous breakdown,&rdquo;&mdash;which generally
means a digestive breakdown&mdash;to be followed
by an era of misery for the unfortunate
subject and his scarcely happier family. Nervous
and irritable, the slightest inconveniences
are magnified into terrible calamities, he constantly
fears death, and his sleepless nights become<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
a saturnalia of gloomy thoughts and abject
fears.</p>

<p>Of course, not everyone guilty of dietetic sins
goes through such sad experiences, for the
naturally strong frequently escape the consequences
of their rashness, particularly where
they live in the rural districts and take plenty
of out-door exercise. Let not such, however,
flatter themselves that their disregard of hygienic
laws will go unpunished. After indiscretions
in eating they will all, at one time or
another, have acute indigestion with diarrh&#339;a;
and how often does the previously well and
hearty man after indiscretion in eating wake
up with a dull headache, furred tongue, foul
breath, and a general feeling of sluggishness
and mental depression?</p>

<p>Is it his liver? Our unscientific medical ancestors&mdash;at
a loss to account for the state of
affairs in any other way&mdash;answered in the affirmative,
and, believing it was produced by a
collection of bile in the liver, called the condition
&ldquo;biliousness.&rdquo; How absurd modern science
has shown this assumption to be! We
now know that the liver is rarely diseased, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
that it furnishes its secretion, called bile, for
the purpose of aiding digestion rather than
hindering it, and that this substance is rarely, if
ever, produced in excess. It is undigested,
putrefying food in the intestinal tract that produces
the trouble. Under such circumstances
one usually takes a dose of calomel, which, being
perhaps the most satisfactory and perfect purgative
that we possess, relieves the condition
promptly by getting rid of the offending material;
but the drug does not act on the liver.</p>

<p>Unfortunately ill results of quite a different
and a much more serious character often follow
in the wake of dietetic errors; in those who
have a tendency to consumption, particularly
where they overwork, this dread disease frequently
makes its appearance as a consequence
of bad eating and drinking. Many, if not all,
of the degenerative diseases that appear in the
latter half of life are produced in this way, and
nothing is more certain than that the peace, happiness
and longevity of mankind could be incalculably
increased by the simple observance of
what is known concerning proper eating and
drinking.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>We will now consider the very important subject
of the quantity and character of foods
which should be taken in health, with suggestions
as to those most suitable for dyspeptics.</p>

<p><i>Over-eating too Prevalent.</i>&mdash;The majority of
us take much more food than is necessary, with
the result that we suffer from indigestion.</p>

<p>When we consume more than a reasonable
amount of food habitually serious digestive disturbances
are sure to result,&mdash;to be often followed
at a later time by tuberculosis, morbid
alterations in the blood-vessels, Bright's disease,
and other serious maladies of a chronic
nature. Professor Chittenden, who is America's
greatest physiological chemist, has demonstrated
that in all probability previous workers
along these lines have been excessive in their
estimates as to the amount of food required.
He showed that a man could live for a period of
nine months on a daily ration which contained
about one-third of the usual amount of proteids
generally thought to be necessary, and at the
same time the fats and carbohydrates were reduced
to such a degree that the total number of
heat units, or calories, liberated from the food<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
scarcely exceeded in number one-half of the
standard requirements. He also experimented
on thirteen volunteers from the hospital corps
of the United States Army, to whom he daily
fed rations of only 2,000 calories, and, notwithstanding
that they engaged in physical work, all
were found to be in better condition at the end
of six months than they were at the beginning.</p>

<p>These results strongly point to the conclusion
that previous estimates as to the quantity of
food required are erroneous, and that man can
not only live, but may continue in strength and
health on much smaller amounts. It is highly
probable that this discrepancy may be accounted
for, at least to a considerable extent,
by the assumption that much of the food ordinarily
taken is rejected by the system, and
passes out as waste, while, when small quantities
are eaten, it is for the most part absorbed.</p>

<p><i>Mastication.</i>&mdash;Thorough chewing of the food
is absolutely essential for proper digestion.
While it is true that this, like all other good
things in life, may be, and often is, carried to an
unnecessary extreme, it is certainly true that we
would be infinitely better off if we were to go to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the extent in this direction of so called &ldquo;Fletcherism&rdquo;
rather than perform this most important
function in an indifferent manner.</p>

<p>This rule applies with especial force to food
of a starchy nature,&mdash;bread, potatoes, oatmeal,
rice, etc. In order to digest food of this character
it must be very thoroughly cooked and
when finally placed upon the table it should be
of such consistence that it requires chewing
before it can be swallowed. Not only is this
necessary from the standpoint of breaking up
the larger particles into smaller ones, thus permitting
the food to pass freely through the
stomach and intestine, but it is of the greatest
importance for it to be thoroughly soaked with
the saliva during the process. It is thus of no
advantage for starches to be served in a finely
divided form&mdash;in fact it is directly the contrary,
since under such circumstances it is almost
always the case that such foods are swallowed
without having been insalivated.</p>

<p>What has been said concerning the mastication
of starches applies with almost equal
force to other foods. Without exception their
digestibility is much increased by thorough<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
chewing. As the result of recent experiments
carried out by means of the X-ray, it has been
shown that particles of food of any considerable
size will not pass from the stomach into the
intestine; as often as an object of this kind attempts
to force its way from the former into
the latter the opening between the two closes,
and as a consequence the food is retained in
the stomach longer than it is in health&mdash;resulting
in the course of time in catarrhal conditions
of the organ just named, and an unnatural
relaxation of its muscular walls.
Under such circumstances the patient quickly
develops symptoms of indigestion, and if his
habits be not corrected the trouble gradually
grows worse until the sufferer becomes a
chronic dyspeptic.</p>

<p><i>Classes of Nutritive Substances.</i>&mdash;All substances
that are of any appreciable value in
nutrition may be divided into those that are
nitrogenous in character (albumins, legumins),
the carbohydrates (starches and sugars) and
compound ethers (fats). Of all these the
nitrogenous foods are the most important,
since they contain the material from which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
great bulk of the body is largely composed,
and at the same time there is every evidence
that in case of need they may be broken up
into chemical substances that may take the
place of any of the other kinds of foods; upon
nitrogenous food, then, a man may live alone,
while this cannot be done on other articles of
diet. The fats, starches and sugars are very
closely related to each other, and it is generally
believed that they subserve much the
same end in the economy; by undergoing chemical
change they furnish energy (heat and muscular
force) and are undoubtedly largely responsible
for the formation of the fats of the
body. While there is some evidence that under
certain conditions alcohol may be a food, its
value is certainly very small, and it is not
of sufficient importance to be considered in
this connection. The ideal diet then for a
healthy man is a proper proportion of nitrogenous
(albuminous) food, along with a reasonable
portion of fats, starches and sugars.
Professors Voight and Atwater have calculated
the following table, which fairly represents
the amount of proteids, fats and carbohydrates<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
that should compose the rations for
twenty-four hours for the ordinary adult male.</p>

<p><i>Calories Defined.</i>&mdash;It should be explained
that the term &ldquo;calorie&rdquo; is one which has been
adopted as a scientific expression for the fuel-value
of substances undergoing oxidation, and
in this connection refers to the heat-producing
capacity of foods. The &ldquo;calorie&rdquo; is the
amount of heat required to raise the temperature
of one gramme of water 1&deg;C. It has been
estimated that starches, sugars and albumins
liberate during combustion 4.1 calories per
gramme, while fats produce 9.3 calories. It
will be noted that in the tables just given the
total number of calories is in each instance
somewhere in the neighborhood of 3,500, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
is considered to be about the number of heat
units required by the average man at moderate
muscular work. The weight of the average
woman being less than that of the adult male,
a reduction of about 20 per cent. from the foregoing
figures would approximate the amount of
food required by the former.</p>

<h3>BREAD AND ITS RELATIONS</h3>


<p>At all times, and among all peoples, bread
has been recognized as one of the great staple
articles of diet. Although its commonly quoted
designation, &ldquo;the staff of life,&rdquo; would more
appropriately belong to the albumins, there can
be no question that breads of one kind or another
are among the most wholesome and necessary
of all food-substances. Not alone is this
true on account of the starch of which they are
largely composed, but they contain more or less
vegetable albumin; it is thus seen that bread
is a mixture of the two most important food-stuffs,
starch and albumin, but the quantity
of the latter is so small that an individual
would have to eat an enormous amount of the
mixture to secure enough of this ingredient
to meet the needs of the body. For practical
purposes, then, we may regard bread as being
starch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Within recent years quacks have disseminated
very widely throughout this country the error that
foods are more digestible when raw. It was long
ago demonstrated that pure albumins, of which eggs
and milk are the nearest natural examples among
foods, are assimilated somewhat better when eaten
raw, but this applies to no other foods except sugars.
Any success that has followed the teachings just referred
to undoubtedly rests purely on the fact that
their followers are instructed to live largely on raw
eggs and milk, and as the patient usually discovers
in a short time that these two foods agree with him
while other uncooked ones do not, he naturally eats
them to the exclusion of the rest and where he takes
a sufficient quantity increases in weight and strength.</p>

<p>The idea that starches are more digestible when
eaten raw could be easily refuted by any intelligent
farm-boy who recalls one or more sad experiences
from over-indulgence in raw sweet potatoes.</p></div>

<p>What shall we look upon as bread? Of course
all such food-stuffs as are commonly included
within this designation are to be accepted; such
as wheat-bread, graham-bread, whole-wheat
bread, biscuits, rolls, light bread, bakers' bread,
waffles and batter-cakes, rye bread, corn bread,
preparations of corn-starch, with which we
should place those articles of diet so commonly
used in the south, usually called grits, hominy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
egg-bread, muffins, corn-meal cakes, potatoes,
both sweet and Irish, arrowroot and the so-called
cereals or breakfast-foods, including oatmeal.</p>

<p>Now which of these is the most wholesome?
This inquiry cannot be answered conclusively
for the reason that the digestibility of this,
as of other foods, depends largely on the individual.
For the sake of clearness the various
breads will now be considered in detail.</p>

<p><i>Wheat-bread the Best.</i>&mdash;It may be confidently
asserted that well-cooked and perfectly
dry wheat-breads are to be regarded as being
generally the most digestible of all bread-stuffs.
This is not dependent on any inherent property
in wheaten starch as a result of which it is
acted upon more readily by the juices whose
office it is to render it fit for absorption in the
body, but is wholly due to the fact that breads
of wheat-flour may be made very dry and light.</p>

<p>As has been already explained, it is particularly
necessary that starches should be
thoroughly soaked in saliva, and this can only
be accomplished when the bread is of such consistence
that it must be chewed for a time, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
so dry that it will readily absorb the salivary
secretion. The writer, then, would advocate
well cooked light-bread or bakers' bread, or
toast made from either, as being the best of all
food-stuffs of this character. The crusts of
biscuit a day or so old are quite digestible, as
are also waffles, if made with little grease and
cooked thoroughly. The soft inner portion of
biscuit and that of hot rolls, as well as batter-cakes,
is decidedly unwholesome.</p>

<p>Graham-bread should not be constantly indulged
in for the reason that it contains multitudes
of sharp particles of the husk of the grain
that cut the delicate mucous membrane of the
stomach and intestines as it passes along, and
if its use be long and continued, severe ill effects
necessarily follow.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In this connection attention should also be called
to the common error that particles of husk are of
advantage to breads of all sorts; the former consist
chemically of exactly the same thing as sand, and are
quite as indigestible, and this, in connection with
what has just been said of their action on the delicate
mucous membranes of the intestinal tract, should
be quite enough to convince anyone that they are
not only useless, but injurious. It is true that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>irritation produced by the husk will oftentimes cause
the bowels to act, but results of the same character
may be induced by many other agencies, within
themselves less harmful.</p></div>

<p><i>Rye-bread.</i>&mdash;There is no reason why rye-bread
should not be prepared in quite as wholesome
a way as is wheaten-bread, and this grain
should undoubtedly rank as one of the best of
the cereals. Its use, however, is so limited in
this country that it is scarcely necessary to go
into a lengthy discussion as to its merits. It
may be remarked that the ergot fungus frequently
grows on this grain, and when ground
up with it occasionally poisons the consumer
where the quantity of the substance is large
and the bread is eaten in considerable quantities.
Instances of this kind are not uncommon
among the peasantry of Europe, where a black
bread made from rye is the staple article of
diet. Of course, when making food-preparations
of rye, we should be careful to have the
flour thoroughly winnowed, and to cook the
bread until sufficiently dry to acquire a proper
consistency for chewing.</p>

<p><i>Corn-bread and Corn Food-products.</i>&mdash;When<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
made from perfectly sound grain, and if not
allowed to undergo fermentative changes afterward,
there can be no question that food-products
of corn are entirely wholesome, and, from
the standpoint of chemical composition, quite
as nourishing as similar articles of diet prepared
from other grains. It is, however, unfortunately
true that we cannot, in the majority
of instances, definitely assure ourselves that
our corn-bread is made from grain that comes
up to the above specification, nor can we be sure
that the meal is fresh, or preserved at such a
temperature as would forbid the growth of
various germs. It has long been known that
bad corn would kill horses, but notwithstanding
this, we have accepted the view that no amount
of deterioration in the grain could result harmfully
to man. That this latter assumption is incorrect
seems now in the highest degree probable.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Pellagra.</i>&mdash;It is known that a very curious and
fatal disease called pellagra is prevalent to a considerable
degree at the present time in the United
States, and it is not going too far to say that all of
those best capable of judging are of the opinion that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>the malady is the result of eating just such corn
as we know kills horses.</p>

<p>It is likewise true that the nutritive power of this
grain could in no way be increased by allowing it
to decay before consumption; indeed, the contrary
must be the case, and, if it were in no manner
actually harmful, our sense of the &aelig;sthetic and of
what is proper to eat, should make us reject in this
case, as with other foods, that which is unsightly to
the eye and unpleasant to the taste. We should no
more eat bad grain than a rotten apple, or putrefying
meat. The increased prevalence of pellagra is
exciting attention all over the United States, and is
very generally assumed to be the result of lack of
care in the harvesting and preservation of our corn.
Instead of being cut before it is ripe, and shocked
in the field during the latter part of the summer,
it should be allowed to ripen on the stalk, and after
cold weather sets in gathered while dry, and preserved
in well-covered and well-ventilated barns.
Every care should be taken to keep it dry while being
shipped from one part of the country to another,
and similar precaution should be observed
with the various food-products made from it. If
kept in a cold place, meal or grits made of good
corn may be preserved in excellent condition for
eating throughout the winter; but as soon as the
warm weather begins they should be stored in the
refrigerator, and should there remain during the
summer; similar precaution should be taken with
meal or other corn-products during the hot months.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>Over a large area of the United States corn-bread
is an article of daily diet with a great
majority of the inhabitants, and its wholesomeness
as compared with other breads becomes,
therefore, an important question. Unfortunately,
corn-meal does not lend itself to the
preparation of a dry bread having sufficient
consistency to require chewing. It is true that
the crusts of the bread made from this grain
answer these requirements fairly well, and there
is therefore no reason why this part of it should
not be used to any extent, provided it be prepared
from good meal. We should endeavor
to cook thin pones of the bread rather than the
thicker ones so common in the south. The objection
that corn-bread can only be masticated
with difficulty applies to the other preparations
of this cereal, such as egg-bread, muffins, etc.,
and they are not, therefore, with the exception
of the crusts, to be looked upon as being the
best form of bread. Corn-cakes, like all batter-bread,
are to be mentioned only to be condemned.
Grits and hominy are soft and moist
and cannot be properly chewed, and are, therefore,
not to be recommended as good breads.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
Corn-starch preparations are likewise entirely
lacking in the elements required to make good
bread, and should only be used occasionally and
in small amounts.</p>

<p><i>Disadvantages of Potatoes.</i>&mdash;Irish potatoes
are eaten almost as commonly in some portions
of the United States as are corn-products in
others, and therefore deserve the careful consideration
of the hygienist. While it is not believed
that, like the latter, potatoes give rise
to any definite disease, it is unfortunately true
that they are theoretically worse breads than
those made from the grain just referred to. In
whatever way cooked, they are moist and require
no chewing, and as a consequence many
persons with delicate digestions do not assimilate
them properly.</p>

<p><i>Arrowroot.</i>&mdash;The preparations of arrowroot
are considered digestible, though here again
we find that such articles of diet are generally
moist and of not proper consistence to be
chewed, and they are, therefore, not as valuable
as are breads made from wheaten flour.</p>

<p><i>Rice.</i>&mdash;Rice is used by a large portion of the
world's inhabitants. When cooked thoroughly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
and very dry, it is perhaps almost as good
bread as is that made from wheat. The starch
granules of the former, like those of arrowroot,
are somewhat smaller than those of wheat.</p>

<p>If it were possible to keep rice-flour in good
condition, and if it could be made into light-bread,
it is likely that it would be superior to
wheaten flour, but this does not appear feasible.</p>

<p>A peculiar and very fatal disease prevails in
the East, known as &ldquo;kak-ke&rdquo; or &ldquo;beri-beri,&rdquo;
which is now generally regarded as being the
result of eating decomposed rice. The writer
has seen one or two examples of what he considers
American beri-beri, but as our rice-eating
population is small, it is not likely that this
disease will ever become a serious problem in
the United States.</p>

<p><i>Cereals or Breakfast-foods.</i>&mdash;Lastly we will
consider the so-called breakfast-foods, which
are neither more nor less than various preparations
of the different varieties of starch. They
are generally made from oats or corn-starch.
They are nothing more than bread, and as some
of them have been put through a sort of fermentation
it is difficult to understand how they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
could be regarded as being quite as wholesome
as the original products from which they were
made. This, however, is not the principal objection
to them. The real trouble lies in the
fact that they are, in the majority of instances,
served with cream and sugar. When we remember
what has already been said about
starches that are soft and cannot be chewed,
and of the ill effects of sweets on persons who
have any inclination towards dyspepsia, it will
be seen that these foods are not to be regarded
as being wholesome. The real reason that
would appear to explain the coming into existence
of these preparations is that they are mixed
with cream and sugar, which appeals strongly
to the &ldquo;sweet-tooth&rdquo; of the average person.
They are nothing but bread, and very bad bread
at that. The remarks made concerning breakfast-foods
apply with equal force to oatmeal,
which, as generally used, has the additional disadvantage
of containing particles of husk.</p>

<p>In concluding this discussion on starchy foods
the writer desires particularly to call attention
to a very common error in the way they are
eaten. Mention has already been made of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
fact that fats after being melted are by no
means so wholesome as in their natural state,
and produce, when heated with starches, a very
indigestible mixture. Thus, theoretically, it is
bad to use any great amount of lard, butter or
other fat in the preparation of breads, and it is
likewise undesirable to spread butter on heated
breads, as is so often done just before eating
biscuits, waffles and batter-cakes. The combination
is certainly a seductive one, and pleasing
to the taste of most persons, but this in no way
invalidates the fact that the mixture is exceedingly
indigestible.</p>

<p><i>Pastries and Cakes.</i>&mdash;Peculiarly unwholesome
are pastries containing any considerable
proportion of fat, and also most varieties of
cake. With the exception possibly of hot batter-cakes
served with an abundance of butter
and syrup, cooks have so far produced no compound
so heinous and totally depraved as pound-cake.
Fruit-cake also stands high up in the list
of undesirable sweets. It certainly passes all
understanding why cooks should continue to persecute
the stomachs of a dependent world with
such highly obnoxious concoctions; the only excuse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
that can be given for them is that the mixtures
are palatable. Where a housekeeper feels
it necessary to prepare cake, she should select
some receipt free from butter or other fat, such
as angel-cake or sponge-cake, both of which
when properly made are exceedingly good to
the taste, and lack the undesirable quality of
containing fats. Explanation for the peculiarly
unwholesome character of food containing
melted grease lies probably in the fact that the
grains of starch under such circumstances must
be to a greater or less extent covered by a thin
layer of the fatty substances, and as a consequence
it is impossible for the saliva to penetrate
to the starch and perform its normal digestive
function.</p>

<h3>MEATS, SUGARS AND MILK</h3>


<p>First in the list of foods the writer would
place those nitrogenous substances commonly
eaten that belong to the class of albumins.
That these substances are in reality the most
important of all food-stuffs there can be no
sort of question, since they, of all things eaten
by the human being, are alone absolutely essential
for his well being and even his existence.
They are the substances that almost exclusively
go to make up the muscle and tendons. Along
with the lime-salts they enter largely into the
composition of the bones and cartilages, brain,
spinal cord and nerves. Other foods are incapable
of taking the place of the albumins, so
that they are absolutely essential for normal
life in the human being.</p>

<p>The amount of albumin necessary for the
normal adult has been variously estimated, the
tendency at the present time being to place the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
quantity needed somewhat lower than was at
one time done. It is probable that about two
ounces of pure albumins is somewhere near the
amount required in twenty-four hours by a
normal adult.</p>

<p>It is well, since we are so dependent on foods
of this class, that we have two quite distinct
sources from which they may be taken. The
great bulk comes to us in the form of meats, including
poultry, game, oysters and fish of various
kinds, in addition to beef, mutton, and hog-meat
in its several forms. Of animal origin
also we have eggs, which are among the most
valuable of all foods of this class on account of
their high digestibility.</p>

<p>From the vegetable world we get albumins
known as legumins, which differ somewhat
from those obtained from animal sources,
though taking their place in the economy in all
essential particulars. Unfortunately the legumins
are usually so mixed with starches and
other vegetable substances less digestible, that
it is necessary to take a large bulk of foods of
this latter class in order to secure anything
like the requisite amount of the former.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>Before taking up individually the various albuminous
foods, the writer would again direct
attention to the chapter on cooking, and would
strongly urge upon the reader the proper
methods of preparing nitrogenous foods therein
stated. Where the albumins are in a nearly
pure state, as in milk and eggs, they are slightly
more digestible when raw, but all meats should
be cooked until only the faintest tinge of red
remains if we wish to have them prepared in
the most wholesome way for those with delicate
digestions. Meats are, as a rule, most wholesome
when cooked &ldquo;very done.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It has long been the cry of sentimentalists that
no living being should die in order that man might
exist. Unfortunately for such theories, the stern
and unbending edict of nature has negatived views
of this kind ages before the altruistic philosopher
came on the scene, and we are daily constrained to
bow to this mandate of one of the primal laws of
existence. However much we might desire it otherwise,
it has been written that &ldquo;only in death is there
life;&rdquo; nor may any animal being disobey and continue
to exist. As has been already explained, the
human being cannot thrive on vegetable substances
alone; from them he may get a certain amount of
nitrogen in the form of legumin, but there is not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>enough to make up for the waste of this substance
that constantly goes on in the body.</p></div>

<p>Theoretically it is of very little importance
which of the meats are selected to supply our
nitrogenous food, but it is unfortunately true
that such foods vary much in digestibility, and
it will therefore be necessary to consider them
separately.</p>

<p><i>Beef.</i>&mdash;When tender and cooked to a proper
degree, beef is considered one of our most
wholesome of meats. Like other foods of this
kind, it should not be fried, but should be broiled
or roasted, and a certain amount of fat may be
eaten along with the lean portions without injury,
and in many persons unquestionably with
benefit.</p>

<p><i>Mutton.</i>&mdash;Of all the coarser meats, mutton is
unquestionably the most digestible, and when
cooked in the same way as directed for beef is
eminently wholesome.</p>

<p><i>Hog-meats.</i>&mdash;On account of the large portion
of fat between the muscle-fibers, hog-meat, particularly
when fresh, is not usually regarded as
being digestible. Some persons eat it with impunity,
but for the vast majority it should be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
taken only in small quantities. It should not be
fried. In the form of ham, hog meat is more
wholesome than when fresh, but even in this
condition many dyspeptics find much difficulty
in digesting it. The best method of cooking it
is to boil thoroughly. After being cooked in this
way and then broiled, it is most appetizing, and
is much more wholesome than when broiled
without being previously cooked. As bacon,
hog-meat enters largely into the dietary of a
great portion of the laborers of this country,
and there can be no doubt that on the whole it
answers the purpose of a staple food admirably.
It contains even more fat than nitrogenous
substances, and may therefore be looked upon
as a mixture of butter and meat. Dyspeptics
cannot eat it with impunity in many instances,
though it agrees far better with them than does
ham or the fresh meat. If it were generally
eaten boiled it would provoke less trouble than
when fried. At this point the writer would repeat
his warning concerning the indigestible
character of melted grease, of which the gravy
from bacon is a striking example.</p>

<p>When &ldquo;cured&rdquo; in a somewhat different way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
hog-meat as &ldquo;breakfast-bacon&rdquo; is very generally
used throughout the civilized world, and is
one of its most wholesome forms. This when
broiled is both appetizing and wholesome, and
should form a part of the daily dietary of everyone
able to afford it.</p>

<p><i>Poultry and Game.</i>&mdash;Among the more delicate
and most wholesome forms in which albumins
are taken we find poultry and game well
up toward the head of the list. Meats of this
character should be very thoroughly cooked
by being either baked, smothered or broiled.</p>

<p><i>Fish.</i>&mdash;Fish of almost all kinds are wholesome
provided they be fresh and properly
cooked. The culinary artist prepares of them
most appetizing and nutritious dishes, and they
are therefore properly to be recommended as
among the best of the albuminous foods.</p>

<p><i>Oysters and Clams.</i>&mdash;Oysters and clams are
usually considered somewhat apart from the
generality of the foods of this character. When
fresh they are wholesome and delicious when
eaten raw, and may be cooked in a great variety
of ways. The reader should be especially
warned that fried oysters are not so wholesome<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
as when they are prepared by other methods,
for the reason that they are surrounded by a
batter containing quantities of melted grease.</p>

<p><i>Eggs.</i>&mdash;Among the most delicate, digestible,
and nutritious of all foods we may place eggs.
Though somewhat more digestible when raw,
they agree, as a rule, even with the most fastidious
stomach, however cooked, even when hard-boiled.
Eggs lend themselves readily to the
formation of many delicious dishes, such as
omelets, souffl&eacute;s, etc.; but unfortunately they do
not contain nutriment in a very concentrated
form, and where an adult is living on them
alone it requires from one and a half to two
dozen daily to furnish the necessary amount
of food.</p>

<p><i>Fats.</i>&mdash;Under the term &ldquo;fats&rdquo; are included
all oily substances, such as butter, lard, olive
and cotton-seed oils, and to a great extent the
fat contained in meats. These substances are
closely related to starches and sugars, and undoubtedly
play a more or less similar r&ocirc;le when
taken into the body as food. From the standpoint
of heat-producing capacity they more than
double, weight for weight, meats and starches,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
and are, therefore, instinctively highly prized by
dwellers in cold countries where much heat is
necessary. In warmer countries the necessity
for excessive heat-production in the body does
not exist.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>While oily substances are certainly capable of adding
to the cushion of fat commonly found beneath
the skin in normal individuals, they are not looked
upon as being to any extent tissue-builders, resembling
in this particular the starches and sugars.</p>

<p>When fats are to be eaten, care should be taken
that they be as fresh as possible, or, if this is not
feasible, they should be preserved in such a way as
to prevent their becoming rancid&mdash;a condition which
is the result of the formation of fatty acids, lending
a peculiarly unpleasant odor and taste, and producing
a decided decrease in food-value. This alteration
may be largely prevented by keeping fats in
a refrigerator at a low temperature, and may also
be greatly retarded by the addition of salt. In this
country butter is usually treated with a very considerable
amount of salt, but in Europe it is universally
served fresh. Within recent years facts
have been established that show that Americans use
an excessive amount of this substance&mdash;possibly causing
disease in some cases; and doubtless we would
be better off if we were to follow the European
practice.</p>

<p>Oily substances when in good condition are certainly
of high value as foods, but should be taken
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>more or less with an eye to the climate, and to the
season of the year. When placed on cold bread and
eaten along with it they are extremely palatable, and
may be taken in reasonable amounts with decided
benefit to the whole body. In temperate climates it
is generally estimated that about three ounces is a
desirable amount for the average adult. In this connection
it may not be out of place to mention that
the various preparations of cod-liver oil, advertised
so freely in the lay press, in some instances actually
do not contain a single particle of the substance that
they are supposed to be principally composed of;
and it may be further stated that there is no good
reason to believe that bulk for bulk oils of this kind
are in any way superior to those fats commonly
eaten. The writer often recalls the saying of a very
wise old physician of his acquaintance that &ldquo;cod-liver
oil is nearly as good as butter.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p><i>Sugars.</i>&mdash;This term includes the large
number of different substances of a more or
less sweetish taste that belong to the group of
carbohydrates. They are closely related to the
starches, and it is generally assumed that they
play much the same part after being taken
into the body. Some of these are of animal
and some of vegetable origin&mdash;but except the
sugar found in milk, the only ones commonly
consumed are those derived from cane, beets,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
and fruits; the sugar from the first two is
known as cane sugar or dextrose, and that from
the latter as grape sugar or glucose. Like albumins
they may be eaten without having been
previously cooked, and are unique in that they
undergo no chemical change whatever as a result
of ordinary degrees of heat.</p>

<p>While the consumption of sugars in all civilized
nations is rapidly increasing, there can be
no question that, irrespective of fruits, they are,
of all foods, the most frequent causes of digestive
disturbances. It is only within comparatively
recent times that mankind has possessed
means of separating sugars in any great bulk
from the plants containing them, and as a consequence
they have only entered prominently
into our every-day diet for a relatively short
period of time. Before this, it is true, they
were consumed to a greater or less extent in
various fruits, but the quantity was insignificant
as compared with the amount now universally
eaten. As a result of this we are now
confronted with a new dietetic problem. For
ages the human stomach has been accustomed
to deal with only small quantities of these substances,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
and developed accordingly a capacity
to digest them proportionate to the amounts
then eaten. Now, however, we constantly call
upon our digestive organs to deal with large
quantities of such foods, and it is not strange
that there has been more or less rebellion on
their part.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Experiments have shown that a small amount of
sugar assists in the normal chemical changes that
go on in the body, and it is, therefore, obvious that
nature intends us to take a certain quantity of it.
Moreover it is true that sugars while being burned
in the body give off much energy&mdash;mainly manifested
in muscular power; where then we are taking
active physical exercise foods of this kind are peculiarly
appropriate. It would, therefore, not be
wise for us to leave this food entirely out of the
dietetic list, but to use it only in small amounts&mdash;particularly
where we lead sedentary lives. Sugar
and alcohol play a more or less similar r&ocirc;le in the
animal economy. It is well known that those who
do not use alcohol are peculiarly prone to consume
considerable quantities of sugar; and it is equally
a matter of common observation that those who
habitually take alcohol rarely eat sweets to any extent.</p>

<p>When sugar is properly assimilated, as seems to
be done most easily by children, it is an excellent
food, but where sweets are over-eaten, and not properly
digested, they give rise to a great accumulation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>of gas in the intestine, and produce in many persons
a marked acidity of the stomach, frequently
accompanied by severe insomnia. Nothing so quickly
relieves such sleeplessness, caused by a &ldquo;sour stomach,&rdquo;
as allowing ten or fifteen grains of ordinary
cooking-soda to slowly dissolve in the mouth and
swallowing the saliva rendered alkaline in this way.</p></div>

<p><i>Milk.</i>&mdash;Milk may be looked upon as an ideal
food, it being composed of water carrying in
solution the three great natural foods&mdash;albumins
in the form of casein, carbohydrates as
milk-sugar or lactose, and fat. Mixed in the
proportion in which they here occur, they are
most admirably adapted to the delicate digestive
apparatus of the infant&mdash;the relative proportion
of the different substances even gradually
changing as the assimilative powers of
the youthful organism increase; it is thus seen
that milk itself is not of constant composition,
even in the same animal, and that it alters in
such a manner as to meet best the needs of the
delicate being depending upon it for proper sustenance.
It is also the case that the composition
of milk varies in different animals&mdash;showing
again how admirably nature exerts its
powers in meeting desired ends.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>The lesson of practicable importance that we
learn from this is that the milk of one of the
lower animals is not in its natural state quite
suited to the delicate stomach of the growing
infant, and that if it be substituted for the
mother's milk it must be more or less altered,
depending upon the age of the child. It is particularly
important that sweet milk be taken
slowly, as otherwise large curds, difficult of digestion,
form as soon as it gets into the stomach.</p>

<h3>FOOD-VALUE OF VEGETABLES</h3>


<p>In recent times we hear much of vegetarianism,
which has its advocates among many highly
intelligent people, and which, as a consequence,
has achieved a certain vogue throughout the
civilized world. It is rarely the case, however,
that those who affect to practice this cult in
reality live exclusively on a vegetable diet. As
a rule it will be found that they are milk-drinkers,
and not infrequently add eggs to their dietary.
It is, of course, absurd to regard as vegetarians
those who simply avoid meat, since it is
true that the nitrogenous substances contained
in milk and eggs differ in no essential particular
from similar substances found in flesh of all
kinds.</p>

<p>Experiments on a somewhat extended scale
have shown within recent years that young and
vigorous individuals at least may live and
thrive on a diet composed largely of vegetables;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
no one has yet shown that a strict vegetable
diet is that best adapted to the average individual,
and no competent authority on this subject
at the present time advocates a diet purely
of this kind. It is true that the vegetables
ordinarily eaten contain all of the elements
that are essential to the animal system, such as
starch, sugar, fat and albumins. Unfortunately,
however, the amount of the last-named
substance is usually so small in food-plants that
the quantity that would have to be eaten by a
normal individual taking active exercise would
cost considerably more than if a reasonable
proportion of animal food were included, and&mdash;which
is of even greater importance&mdash;the digestive
powers of the individual who attempted
to live only on food of this character would
be severely taxed, and, in the long run, probably
seriously impaired. Furthermore, vegetables
and fruits contain substances, usually in great
quantity, that are scarcely acted upon at all by
the digestive juices. Chief among the latter
is cellulose, which, while forming the great
bulk of the food of herbivorous animals, is
scarcely suited to the weaker digestive capacity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
of the human being; practically none of it is
converted to the uses of the body. It is thus
seen that in the average man or woman a dietary
consisting largely of vegetables would result
in the presence in the intestines of a greater
or less bulk of indigestible materials, which
could subserve no good purpose other than that
they would by their mechanical presence have
a tendency to cause the bowels to act; as is the
case with fruits, however, it is unfortunately
true that this large residue of undigested food,
in one way or another, often gives rise to considerable
irritation of the mucous membrane of
the intestine, and frequently produces dyspeptic
disturbances, among which looseness of the
bowels is common.</p>

<p>This brings us to a consideration of the digestibility
of vegetables in general, which is always
the paramount consideration when dealing
with the value of any substance to be used
as a food. It has been before remarked that
young and vigorous persons seem to thrive on a
dietary largely of vegetable character, but the
case is certainly quite different with older people,
particularly where their digestive powers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
are impaired. In the latter we often find that
severe intestinal disturbances follow even after
moderate indulgence in vegetable foods&mdash;particularly
where they are served with vinegar, or
some other fruit acid. Another peculiarity of
foods of this kind that makes decidedly against
their digestibility lies in the fact that, being
soft and containing a large proportion of water,
they are scarcely ever properly chewed, and as
a consequence they are swallowed in comparatively
large masses without having been adequately
insalivated.</p>

<p>Vegetables may be roughly classified as
legumes, roots and tubers, and green vegetables,
and will now be considered briefly in the order
named.</p>

<p><i>Legumes,&mdash;Beans, Peas, Lentils, and Peanuts.</i>&mdash;With
the exception of the cereals, the
legumes are the most valuable of all vegetable
foods. Their nutritious properties are mainly
due to their relatively high percentage of nitrogenous
material, though they also contain starch
and fat. Hence these vegetables contain the ingredients
necessary to supply all the needs of
the human economy; unfortunately, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
when eaten alone in sufficient bulk to furnish the
nourishment required, they often&mdash;even in
healthy individuals&mdash;give rise after a little time
to dyspeptic disturbances.</p>

<p>Of beans, a large number of different varieties
are in common use including string-beans
(or snap-beans), lima-beans, kidney-beans, red
beans, the frijole, and the Soya bean. String-beans
are exceedingly palatable, and are very
much prized as an article of diet by the peoples
of all countries. When gathered young and
thoroughly cooked while still fresh they are exceedingly
wholesome, and are very well assimilated,
when properly chewed, by even those
whose digestions are considerably impaired.
The other beans named are generally eaten dry
after having been removed from the pod in
which they grow. When they are soaked in
water until they become soft and then
thoroughly cooked they make an excellent food,
and, when not taken in too great quantities, are
fairly digestible. When cooked with onions,
parsley, and red pepper in proper proportions
they make a very delicious dish. In Japan the
Soya bean forms the basis for a kind of vegetable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
cheese which is eaten with rice, and furnishes
the nitrogenous materials in which the
latter is deficient. Peas are wholesome when
young and fresh and when properly cooked, and
as they come on in the early spring when other
fresh vegetables cannot be obtained, they furnish
a most acceptable addition to the dietary.
When old, after their skins become tough, they
cease to be digestible, and should not be eaten
except in the form of purees, during the preparation
of which the hull is removed.</p>

<p>Lentils are scarcely eaten at all in America,
but are much prized in some portions of the
Old World, as the basis of soups.</p>

<p>Peanuts belong to the group of legumes,
though, unlike the others that serve as food,
they grow beneath the surface of the ground.
They are highly nutritious, but are, unfortunately,
indigestible, owing largely to the high
percentage of oil that they contain. The latter
is extracted, and is sometimes sold as olive-oil;
in a somewhat different form it is made into
a sort of butter which is quite palatable.</p>

<p><i>Roots, Tubers, and Yams.</i>&mdash;Sweet and Irish
potatoes, which constitute the most important<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
members of this group, have already been discussed
under the head of breads. Of those that
remain, some few, as beets and artichokes, may
be regarded as related to those just referred to,
while others, such as carrots, turnips, radishes,
parsnips, etc., are generally reckoned among the
succulent tubers on account of the large proportion
of juice that they contain. Irrespective of
the beet, which furnishes a considerable portion
of the sugar of commerce, none of them may be
looked upon as foods of a very important character,
as they contain only relatively small proportions
of sugars, starches, and nitrogenous
materials. Beets, however, do contain a very
high percentage of that which makes potatoes so
popular,&mdash;about eighty-five per cent. of starches
and sugars, with only a trifle of nitrogenous
material. When young and tender they are
often eaten as a salad, either alone or mixed
with other vegetables, and are generally regarded
as being wholesome and highly nutritious.
They should not be eaten by dyspeptics
when pickled, on account of the vinegar.</p>

<p>Artichokes are occasionally eaten, but are not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
nutritious, although they agree well with many
persons.</p>

<p>Carrots, when young and fresh, are fairly digestible,
but like other vegetables are exceedingly
apt, particularly if old, to produce intestinal
disturbances in dyspeptics. They are not
very commonly eaten in the United States, but
where selected with care we would profit by
their more frequent use. They contain a small
percentage of starches, with an insignificant
proportion of vegetable albumin.</p>

<p>Turnips are exceedingly unwholesome, contain
very little nourishment, and may be eaten
with impunity only by persons in vigorous
health. The same remarks apply to radishes,
and to parsnips.</p>

<p><i>Green Vegetables.</i>&mdash;Vegetables of this class
are of much more value from the standpoint of
their agreeable taste, and the consequent stimulating
effect upon the appetite, than from the
nutritive materials that they contain. Some of
them are eaten cooked, while others are usually
consumed in a raw state. They are all much
less indigestible if eaten when quite young and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
fresh&mdash;drying seemingly having the effect of
producing alterations in them that predispose
to dyspeptic disturbances in those so inclined.</p>

<p>Spinach is one of the most digestible of the
entire group, and is much eaten in all parts of
the world.</p>

<p>Turnip-tops differ in no essential particular
from spinach. They have a somewhat bitter
taste, but when young and fresh are highly
palatable, and if thoroughly cooked cause comparatively
little intestinal trouble, but like
spinach they contain practically no nourishment.
The same may be said of the leaves of
various other plants commonly served as
greens, among them beet-tops, and dandelion-tops.</p>

<p>Cabbages, many different kinds of which are
habitually eaten as food in civilized countries,
have comparatively little nutritive value, and
are, generally speaking, decidedly indigestible,
although young and vigorous persons, particularly
where they take abundant out-door exercise,
find no difficulty in assimilating the inner
portions of the fresh cabbage &ldquo;head.&rdquo; As in
the case with other vegetables, the soil and locality<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
in which the cabbage is grown largely influences
its taste, and to some extent its digestibility.
It should never be given to infants.
Sauerkraut is a preparation of cabbage leaves
produced by adding salt, and later crushing
them with considerable pressure; after a time
alterations occur of a fermentative character,
and the product is generally regarded as more
wholesome than fresh cabbage.</p>

<p>Cauliflower consists of masses of the somewhat
modified flowers of a plant closely related
to the cabbage, and is, when properly prepared,
palatable, and perhaps somewhat more digestible
than cabbage. Cole, and Brussels sprouts,
are plants of the cabbage family, and are perhaps
even more indigestible.</p>

<p><i>Salad Plants.</i>&mdash;The leaves of the lettuce are
usually eaten raw, most commonly being
served as a salad in combination with oil and
vinegar, or lemon juice. That the leaves possess,
when treated in this way, a very palatable
taste all will perhaps agree, but they cannot be
said to be of any nutritive value, nor are the
acids just referred to conducive to their digestibility.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>On account of their somewhat pungent taste,
watercresses are used in many parts of the
world as ingredients of salads, but they are, of
all vegetables, the ones that are most liable to
transmit disease to man, for in addition to the
possibility of contracting in this way typhoid
fever, dysentery, cholera, and the ordinary intestinal
worms, the human being is apt to receive
with them the eggs of the flukes, and the
spores of the am&oelig;b&aelig; that produce chronic tropical
dysentery. As they are probably never
grown under such conditions as to preclude the
possibility of this danger, it would be the part of
wisdom to absolutely refrain from their use.</p>

<p><i>Onions, Leeks, Shallots, and Garlic.</i>&mdash;Vegetables
of this group are eaten either raw or
cooked, and of all those consumed in the former
state are least liable to transmit disease, owing
to the fact that they are nearly always thoroughly
peeled before being eaten. They have
the advantage, furthermore, that they may be
preserved for long periods of time in such a way
as to be fit for food, and when properly cooked
have a delicate flavor, and are quite wholesome
although furnishing little food for the body.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
Garlic is never eaten as a vegetable, but serves
as the basis for many of the delicate sauces for
which the French cooks are so justly celebrated.</p>

<p>The tomato has been used as a food only
within comparatively recent times, it having
been formerly thought to be poisonous. Like
the onion it may be eaten either raw or cooked,
and if taken in moderation does not, as a rule,
produce any serious harm. When eaten in
greater quantities, both on account of the acid
that it contains and its relatively small proportion
of assimilable nutriment, the tomato is exceedingly
prone to cause intestinal disturbances,
and should rather be regarded as a fruit than a
vegetable. Growing at some distance from the
ground, it is rather less apt to convey diseases
than the majority of vegetables eaten in a raw
state.</p>

<p>While celery is generally eaten raw, it furnishes
a palatable dish when cooked in milk.
It should not be eaten by dyspeptics or children,
particularly if raw. Similarly the cucumber has
a well-merited reputation for producing dyspeptic
disturbances. It is only eaten raw, is frequently
served as a salad, and should be used<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
only when very young and fresh, and eaten only
by persons of sound digestion.</p>

<p>Okra is much prized in the Southern States
as the principal ingredient of a very palatable
soup, but is not as a rule looked upon with favor
by the uninitiated. It is also much eaten boiled
and served with a little butter and pepper.
When fresh and young it is fairly digestible,
and furnishes a very agreeable addition to the
dinner.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In addition to those already referred to, there are
a number of vegetables that are very popular either
alone, or in combination as salads&mdash;particularly in
the South; among them are green peppers, parsley,
mint, capers, endive, and chicory. The remarks
already made concerning green vegetables apply
equally to these just mentioned, and it should here
again be particularly insisted upon that salads containing
acids are unwholesome for infants and children,
and should be used sparingly even by those in
health. None contains much nourishment.</p>

<p>Among easily digestible vegetables asparagus probably
takes front rank, and in addition to this has the
merit of being exceedingly agreeable to the taste.
It possesses little nutritive value, but when young,
fresh, and well cooked, it may be taken even by
infants without harm.</p>

<p>Rhubarb, or &ldquo;pie plant,&rdquo; is eaten stewed, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>made into pie. It is said to be somewhat laxative,
and is decidedly more wholesome than many others.
The squash, when properly cooked is comparatively
wholesome, but contains little nourishment, and is
of no particular value as a food, and the pumpkin
is not much better, although useful during the winter
for making pies after the ordinary vegetables
and fruits are gone.</p>

<p>Cranberries, when thoroughly cooked and separated
from the hulls, form the basis of a delicious jelly
that is widely eaten in the winter over all portions
of the United States. Like all sweets it is not entirely
wholesome for dyspeptics or infants, but as it
is usually eaten with meats and not in great quantities,
it may be looked upon as being one of the
most wholesome of all foods of this class. It does
not seem to have such a tendency to produce sour
stomach in many dyspeptics as is so frequently done
by other foods containing vegetable acids.</p></div>

<h3>DANGER IN FRUITS AND PICKLES</h3>


<p>It is an error shared almost universally by
both medical men and the laity that fruits and
raw foods are wholesome. Everyone is familiar
with the fact that fruits produce intestinal
disturbances in children,&mdash;not only when
they are very young, but after their digestive apparatus
is fully developed. Rather curiously,
however, instead of ascribing the disturbances
that follow to the real cause, we generally dismiss
the matter with the assertion that &ldquo;early
fruits are unhealthy,&rdquo; or trace the resulting ill
effects to some other equally imaginary factor.
In reality the reason why diarrh&#339;a and other
intestinal troubles so often occur after eating
fruits in the early spring is that the boy or girl
after a winter's fast greedily devours enormous
quantities of them when they first ripen, and
disturbances follow in proportion to the amount
and character of these substances taken.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>There can be no question that fruits, while
extremely palatable, usually produce trouble in
dyspeptics, and even in those who still possess
unimpaired digestive organs ill effects quite
constantly follow on the heels of the taking of
food of this character. Unfortunately, however,
the great majority of dyspeptics have
symptoms that in no way outwardly point
toward digestive errors; as common examples,
we might refer to the blackheads, pimples and
small boils, so frequently observed on the faces
of young boys and girls, or the rheumatic pains,
and, at a later time, the &ldquo;Bright's disease,&rdquo; that
occur in older people. When you tell such patients
that their trouble is indigestion, they are
often mildly indignant, and loudly protest that
they can eat anything with impunity; that they
never have heart-burn, feelings of heaviness
after eating, pains in the abdomen, or other
symptoms referable to the stomach and intestines.
We are rather disposed to be proud of
our digestive powers, just as we are of our bodily
strength, and nothing is more common than
for chronic dyspeptics to maintain that they
have never had indigestion in their lives,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
and to resent any insinuation to the contrary.</p>

<p>Another popular error, almost universally accepted,
is that fruits are highly nutritious; as
a matter of fact they consist almost wholly of
water, and of materials that are utterly indigestible.
The latter substances pass through
the alimentary tract, therefore, in much the
same condition that they enter and serve no better
purpose than to promote, somewhat, activity
in the bowels. Nevertheless the writer does not
wish to be misunderstood as advocating total
abstinence from such a palatable class of foods;
no harm results in most people if they only take
perfectly ripe and fresh fruits in moderation
now and then; and these should be always eaten
after meals rather than before.</p>

<p>The fruits that contain comparatively little
acid are, as a rule, more wholesome than those
that are rich in substance of this kind. For
example, perfectly fresh and ripe figs or peaches
may be taken by most persons with impunity
if they be eaten after meals, and at intervals
of at least two or three days. Acid fruits, particularly
lemons, seem to be peculiarly unwholesome;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
apples are prone to cause trouble and can
rarely be eaten without ill effects, however mellow
and palatable they may be. It sometimes
happens that persons take grape-fruit with less
harm than others.</p>

<p>Closely akin to fruits in their deleterious action
on the digestive apparatus are sours in any
form whatever. Women, especially, indulge
freely and at irregular hours in foods containing
much vinegar, lemon-juice, etc.,&mdash;usually in
the form of pickles or salads. In healthy persons,
in moderation, foods of this character perhaps
produce no appreciable trouble, but nothing
is more thoroughly established than that
they act harmfully on the general run of dyspeptics,
such as most of us are to a greater or less
degree after thirty years of age. This leads to
the remark that here, as in everything else, we
must regard individual peculiarities&mdash;it being
true that one person can eat without ill effects
what may produce decided disturbances in
others, or suffer from excess when moderation
would entail no ill-effects.</p>

<h3>DRINKS&mdash;PROPER AND HARMFUL</h3>


<p>An immense amount of rubbish has been written
during the last few decades concerning the
supposed good effect of excessive water-drinking
on the human economy. Something like a
quarter of a century ago a London physician by
the name of Haig brought forward and strenuously
advocated the view that a large number
of minor ailments were the result of the presence
in the body of excessive quantities of uric acid;
applying the well known fact that the substance
just mentioned requires a large amount of
water to dissolve it he conceived the idea that
the proper remedy was to flood the body with
enormous quantities of liquids, and thus, as it
were, wash the offending substance out of the
system. So plausible did he make this theory
appear that it was accepted very largely by medical
men, who in turn taught it to the general
public. Within recent times it has been fortunately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
shown that Haig's theory was wholly
chimerical, and that quantities of uric acid
greatly in excess of the normal amount could
collect in the body, or might be injected into
the blood-vessels, without the least harm resulting;
thus, at one blow, this widely accepted
theory was annihilated, and there now remains
no sort of reason for attempting to remove uric
acid by excessive water-drinking, or by other
means.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is fortunate that the uric-acid theory has been
disproved, for the excessive use of water is not only
unnecessary, but highly injurious to the digestive
organs, particularly when the fluids are taken at or
about meals. Experience has shown that excessive
stomach-acidity, which is the most common form of
indigestion, is in a large degree dependent on the
taking of liquids while eating, and that even in those
who are healthy any more than small quantities
cannot be looked upon as being wholesome. In
dyspeptics liquids seem to act in a hurtful way in
several different directions. For example, where
persons constantly take liquids while eating the necessity
of properly chewing the food is largely done
away with; in addition to this the mere presence of
water in the stomach seems to tend to the production
of increased acidity, for it has often been observed
by the writer that even where food was eaten dry
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>indigestion would follow in many dyspeptics if
they took water just before or immediately after
eating.</p></div>

<p>The only sensible advice that can be given in
this connection is that persons should take no
more liquids that they feel a desire for, and
they should avoid taking them in any quantity
about meal time. What has just been said concerning
water applies equally well to milk.
When taken alone it very frequently agrees with
patients much better than does solid food, but
when mixed with the latter is prone to produce
indigestion, just as does water. Fermented
milk in the form of buttermilk is a very popular
beverage in some parts of the world, but
it may be well doubted as to whether it deserves
the reputation for wholesomeness generally accorded
it; being a liquid, and at the same time
acid, it is peculiarly prone to increase acidity,
and is not tolerated by persons who suffer with
sour stomach. It should, however, be said that
it, on the other hand, seems to agree particularly
well with some people, and has been known
when taken alone, at least temporarily, to relieve
obstinate forms of indigestion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Coffee.</i>&mdash;The most universal beverage taken
at meal time in America is undoubtedly coffee.
Each morning countless thousands are cheered
and stimulated by its invigorating properties to
undertake their daily tasks, but, as is always the
case after taking drugs that have such action
the system has to pay the penalty in a reaction
following later, during which the capacity for
work is diminished. It is, however, true that
the effect last referred to is not of such importance
as to constitute in itself a serious objection
to the use of coffee, but other ill results
are rather prone to ensue that in many instances
change the aspect of the question entirely. In
a great many people, particularly after the first
vigor of youth has passed, coffee produces anything
but pleasant effects, and on some it seems
to act as a downright poison. Like all liquids
taken at meal time, it predisposes to acid indigestion,
particularly when it is sweetened. It
is likewise true that when it contains any considerable
quantity of cream the liability to
dyspeptic disturbances following its use are particularly
great&mdash;doubtless as a result of the considerable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
quantity of melted fats that it contains
under such circumstances.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>From the foregoing it appears then that coffee
without either cream or sugar is less unwholesome
than when these substances are added to it, but even
when it is taken in this way it causes decided symptoms
of indigestion in many persons. The writer
is not of the opinion that the habitual taking of
coffee is to be commended, and would, therefore,
not advise its constant use; it, however, must be admitted&mdash;as
is the case with all other substances that
cause indigestion&mdash;that in many people, and particularly
in those who live out-of-doors and are actively
engaged in physical occupations, the use of coffee
seems to result in no harm. Like other substances
that cause indigestion in a concentrated form, coffee
when largely diluted is less apt to produce disturbances
of this kind; for example, a beverage consisting
of two-thirds of hot skimmed milk and one-third
coffee may be taken by many dyspeptics in
reasonable amounts without any particular harm.
Parents should be warned against allowing growing
children to drink coffee; it seriously interferes with
the normal chemical changes going on in their bodies,
and is almost certain to be followed in later life by
nervous dyspepsia.</p></div>

<p><i>Tea.</i>&mdash;The stimulating principle of tea is
chemically so nearly like that of coffee that they
are generally considered as being one and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
same. That they differ decidedly in their action
on the stomach and the body generally
there can, however, be no doubt. The stimulating
action of tea comes on more slowly than
that of coffee, and is correspondingly prolonged.
In most persons it is not so apt to produce nervousness,
nor is its action in preventing sleep
so pronounced. On the stomach it also produces
effects that are diametrically opposed to
those induced by coffee, since, instead of stimulating,
it seems actually to retard the secretion
of acids. It is, therefore, probably true that we
should look upon tea as a beverage with much
less disfavor than we do coffee&mdash;though, of
course, it should always be remembered that
there may be, and unquestionably are, many exceptions
to this judgment.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Probably no other daily article of food or drink
is so commonly prepared in an improper manner as
tea&mdash;which is all the more curious when we consider
that perhaps none other that requires heat for its
preparation is so easily made. It should be brewed
by simply pouring boiling water upon the leaves,
but the vessel containing the decoction should not
be placed over the fire while the tea is being prepared.
Of even greater importance is the necessity
of allowing the water to remain in contact with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>leaves only a few moments&mdash;<i>never more than a
minute if we wish the tea to be good</i>. The reason
for the latter precaution lies in the fact that tea-leaves
contain a considerable amount of tannic acid,
and, as the longer the water and leaves remain together
the more of this substance is extracted from
the latter, it is not difficult to see that we should
be careful to allow only a brief contact between the
two; the presence of this acid is undesirable, not only
on account of the fact that it gives to the decoction
a bitter and unpleasant taste, but because it has a
tendency to cause digestive disturbances. It is seemingly
not generally known that there are many
varieties of tea, and that some of them are so superior
in flavor and bouquet to others that they
might well be entirely different substances. The
best of all (in the writer's opinion) are those that
are composed largely of leaves grown in Ceylon,
usually mixed with India tea. If we will demand
of our grocer a first-class Ceylon tea we will find
that a beverage may be made from it that will appeal
quite as much to the palate as a good coffee.</p>

<p>Before dismissing this subject finally, some reference
should be made to ice-tea. This beverage is
exceedingly palatable when properly prepared, and
under such circumstances by no means deserves the
disfavor with which it is regarded by many. The
latter circumstance is entirely due to two things;
first, we find too frequently that it is the habit of
house-keepers to pour boiling water on the leaves
when the midday meal is cooked and to allow them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>to soak together until night, and second, the fact
that lemon-juice is very commonly added to the tea
before being drunk. The ice that the tea contains
has little or nothing to do with the dyspeptic disturbances
that frequently follow the drinking of cold
tea. If we will leave out the lemon and pour off the
water after it has been in contact with the tea leaves
for something like a minute, it will be discovered that
practically all of the ill effects usually ascribed to
this palatable beverage have been done away with.</p></div>

<p><i>Alcohol.</i>&mdash;A discussion of beverages would
not be complete without some mention of those
containing alcohol. This at once brings us face
to face with the bitter controversy on this subject
that has been waged so long throughout
the United States, and which can only be considered
here from the standpoint of the effects
of alcohol on the human economy, and to draw
corresponding conclusions.</p>

<p>That alcohol, even in very small quantities,
reduces the general strength and capacity for
work there can be no question, and in addition
we find from experiments carefully conducted on
the lower animals that the liability to infection
by various disease-producing germs is greatly
increased by the administration of even minute<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
amounts of the drug. A man then who is a
habitual user of alcoholic drinks not only
thereby diminishes his capacity to labor effectually,
but at the same time renders himself
more liable to disease. No more striking example
of this could be brought forward than the
well established fact that persons who use alcohol
are exceedingly prone to consumption&mdash;so
true is this, indeed, that we might almost look
upon the drug as being practically the cause of
this disease in most instances. Of course the
bacillus of tuberculosis must be present in order
for the malady to develop, but we find that the
alcohol has prepared a soil for the growth of
the germ which would not otherwise exist.
This holds with equal force as regards other infectious
diseases.</p>

<p>Again, it is true that maladies that result
from bad digestion and improper assimilation
are frequently produced by the habitual use of
alcoholic liquors. Gout and Bright's disease
are in the vast majority of cases the indirect off-spring
of habitual drinking. It should be noted&mdash;and
the distinction is of importance&mdash;that the
affections of a grave character most frequently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
produced by the alcoholic habit do not ensue as
a consequence of what could be rightly called
intemperate taking of the drug,&mdash;its moderate
use more commonly resulting in serious disease
than when it is taken in great excess.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The explanation of this probably lies, at least in
part, in the fact that the majority of drunkards
only take alcohol at greater or less intervals, and as
a consequence the system has time to recuperate between
sprees. The typical dipsomaniac goes weeks,
months, and even years without drinking at all, but
when he is seized by the desire for drink he throws
everything else aside and spends days and weeks in
a prolonged debauch; during this period he eats very
little, and as a consequence largely avoids the grave
dyspeptic disturbances that would otherwise inevitably
result. Alcoholics of this class acquire catarrhal
conditions of their stomachs, and if seized with some
acute disease, like pneumonia, during or just after
a spree, quickly die in a large proportion of cases,
but they do not develop gout or Bright's disease as
a rule, nor do they very commonly become consumptive,
as is the case with those who take the drug in
small quantities day by day. Furthermore, it would
appear that the grave disorders that so frequently
follow the long-continued use of alcohol cannot be
said to be the direct result of the use of the drug,
but ensue as a consequence of the stimulating action
of the alcohol on the appetite, leading to over-eating.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
Under such circumstances indigestion follows
from excessive over-feeding, and this is added
to by the naturally irritating effect of the alcohol
on the stomach. When this is continued through a
series of years, the assimilating power of the organism
gradually deteriorates, and we begin to meet
with chronic dyspepsia, acute Bright's disease, and
cirrhosis of the liver. Let no one then consider that
he is not misusing alcohol for the reason that he
only takes a drink before meals&mdash;it would be far
better if he were to go on a moderate spree occasionally.</p></div>

<p>In this connection mention should be made of
the great evil of patent medicines containing,
and in reality essentially consisting, of alcohol.
A vast number of them are widely sold under
the misleading statement that they relieve catarrh,
cure diseases of the kidneys, and that they
act as tonics and general invigorants of the entire
system. Masquerading under one guise or
another they are sold to the unsuspecting public&mdash;prohibitionists
for the most part&mdash;who fondly
imagine that their glass of &ldquo;bitters,&rdquo; &ldquo;liver-regulator,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;safe cure for the kidneys,&rdquo; is entirely
harmless. Let all such be warned that
with scarcely an exception patent medicines of
this class are nothing more nor less than poor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
whisky containing some bitter to disguise the
taste, and that they are in fact taking a drink
when they use nostrums of this kind. The ultimate
effect of this kind of drinking is to produce
serious and grave diseases.</p>

<p>This discussion of the effect of alcohol on the
human body would not be complete without calling
attention to the extraordinary fact that those
peoples to whom we owe our modern civilization
have from time immemorial, most of all others,
consumed the greatest amount of alcohol. Explain
it as we may, the fact remains that the
greatest achievements of the world were brought
about by a society in which a very large proportion
of its members were in the habit of more
or less constantly taking alcoholic beverages.
Naturally, the query is forced upon us whether
this drug may not have played some important
part in the great results achieved. Unfortunately,
no one can answer one way or another,
but our very ignorance should emphasize the importance
of looking at the question from every
side, and not jumping at conclusions before they
are warranted by facts. It is true that most of
our positive knowledge on this subject would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
condemn alcohol as being the greatest curse of
the ages, but it may be that it has played a
beneficent part in the affairs of mankind
through devious paths impossible to trace. Unquestionably
a drug, the taking of which assists
us in momentarily throwing our troubles
aside, must be of a certain positive value to
mankind. If only it possessed these good qualities
with none of its bad ones!</p>

<p>Having considered very briefly the general effects
of alcohol on the system a few remarks
may be appropriately made concerning the several
beverages commonly consumed in the
United States for which it serves as a basis.</p>

<p><i>Whisky.</i>&mdash;Under the term whisky will here
be included all of those stronger alcoholic beverages
that are the product of distillation. In
addition to those commonly designated as such
we may reckon brandy, gin, and rum, and at
the same time those subtle combinations called
mixed-drinks, for which they serve as a basis.
It will, perhaps, startle the average reader when
the statement is made that whisky and its near
relatives just referred to, particularly when diluted
by water, are by far the least harmful of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
all alcoholic drinks. Their bad reputation lies
in the fact that on account of their large percentage
of alcohol they are usually preferred by
drunkards, and that when consumed in excessive
amounts by those unaccustomed to their
use there often follow those frightful crimes
with which these particular forms of alcohol
are so odiously associated. The facts are, however,
that when taken in moderation they are
much less prone to produce indigestion than
wines or malt liquors, and where one is determined
to drink, they should unquestionably
receive the preference. It should not be understood
that the writer is in any way advocating
their use, but the facts of experience compel
him to state frankly that the least harmful of
all alcoholic beverages is whisky, or its near
relatives.</p>

<p><i>Wines.</i>&mdash;There are a large number of fermented
juices of fruits that are known as wines.
They are either sweet or acid in taste, and both
are peculiarly prone to induce dyspepsia in
persons with delicate stomachs. Irrespective
of their delicate flavor, which, in many instances,
appeals strongly to the palate, the only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
virtue that they may be said to possess is that
they contain alcohol in small amounts; this,
however, is off-set entirely by their large percentage
of sugars and acids, causing them to be
much more unwholesome than plain whisky.</p>

<p><i>Beers and Malt Liquors.</i>&mdash;It is very fortunate
that in those states of the American Union
that have recently enacted prohibition laws,
beer and other malt liquors are now being
widely sold under the plea that they are non-intoxicating
and that they are in no way unwholesome.
While it is true that the former
claim is in a measure correct, it is a fact well
understood by those who have given the matter
study that they are perhaps the most unwholesome
of all alcoholic beverages. Those in the
habit of using them are almost universally
under the impression that they are harmless,
and as the taste for them is easily cultivated,
those who once acquire the habit are very apt
to take them in greater or less quantities daily.
As a result of this, chronic digestive disturbances
are always sooner or later set up, and the
victim in the course of time often acquires a
gouty tendency, which is all the more dangerous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
for the reason that in America it scarcely
ever manifests itself in acute joint inflammations.
The patient gets into what has been
called a &ldquo;lithemic&rdquo; state, which is but another
name for gout, and sooner or later is exceedingly
apt to develop a chronic form of Bright's
disease. It is greatly to be deplored that some
of our professional national school-masters do
not address themselves to this subject rather
than to appealing to the worst passions of the
ignorant in attacking the great institutions of
our country, and in assailing the fundamental
principles of our government that come down to
us as a priceless heritage from the wise and
patriotic statesmen who first brought our nation
into life.</p>

<p>In addition to the three great classes of alcoholic
beverages already considered there are
innumerable others, fortunately but little known
to the general public, and prized only by connoisseurs
in such matters. As we happily have
no problem confronting us in any way similar
to the absinthe-habit, so common in France, it
is not deemed necessary here to do more than
merely to refer to them.</p>

<h3>IMPORTANCE OF GOOD COOKING</h3>


<p>Reference has already been made to certain
misconceptions concerning cooking diligently
circulated in recent years by various quacks.
The victim is advised that he must take large
quantities of raw eggs and milk, and at the
same time is instructed to eat a number of
other specially prepared articles furnished at
a stiff price and certified as being raw by the
&ldquo;medical company&rdquo; furnishing the &ldquo;treatment.&rdquo;
Since it is quickly discovered by those
who are entrapped by charlatans of this kind
that the only raw foods that they can take with
comfort and without disgust are milk and eggs,
they naturally practically live on these alone,
and as these foods are extremely digestible and
nutritious, improvement in the patient's condition
not uncommonly results.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is unquestionably true that
the vast majority of foods are greatly improved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
in digestibility, and are rendered much more
palatable by thorough cooking. After being
properly cooked there develop in foods certain
flavors and odors that are highly appetizing,
and unquestionably aid in the subsequent digestion
of the same. With but few exceptions,
foods are so altered by heat that their proper
mastication becomes much easier, and cooking,
therefore, materially aids in reducing them to a
state in which they are much more readily acted
upon by the digestive juices. It should never
be forgotten, also, that cooking is of the utmost
importance from the standpoint of killing
bacteria and animal parasites that may be present
in food. If we were to adopt universally the
habit of eating everything raw, the general
mortality would certainly be considerably increased.</p>

<p><i>Cooking of Starchy Foods.</i>&mdash;Nothing in the
whole art and science of preparing food for
the human being is of so much importance as
the proper cooking of starches. As a result
of the heat employed, certain chemical changes
are induced in the starch-granules, as a consequence
of which they are rendered digestible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
It is of fundamental importance that at all
times and under all circumstances the cooking
of this class of foods should be as thorough as
is possible, for when this is not done digestive
disturbances are sure to follow, and much of
the food is actually wasted. There are but few
cardinal principles in the ordinary hygiene of
life that are so commonly neglected as this,
since it is the habit of a large proportion of the
American people to consume three times a day
masses of tenacious starch which has not been
acted upon by heat sufficiently to render it digestible.</p>

<p>Of all the different methods of cooking
starches, by far the most common, and, therefore,
the most important, is the process called
baking. While it is not possible in this volume
to go into the subject with the thoroughness
that it deserves, the principal points deserve
some mention. They may be briefly stated as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) The flour must be made into a dough in which
are incorporated substances that produce a gas called
carbon dioxide, which, forming in innumerable small
bubbles throughout the mass, cause the whole to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>swell; when this is completed the bread is said to
have &ldquo;risen.&rdquo; Of course the object of this is to
produce a thorough breaking up of the sticky dough&mdash;with
the result that when the bread is finally
cooked it is light and fluffy, and can be readily masticated.</p>

<p>(2) After the process just described has been
completed the bread should be thoroughly cooked,
for reasons which have already been explained.</p>

<p>(3) After cooking has been accomplished the bread
should be thoroughly dried, either by keeping it hot
until this occurs, or, what is better, permitting it
to remain warm for a time and then allowing the
process to be completed in a natural way by putting
the bread aside for several days. It is necessary for
bread to be dried in order that it may be thoroughly
soaked in saliva during the process of chewing.</p></div>

<p>If the principles above enunciated be properly
followed out, good wholesome bread will result.
There are, of course, many details connected
with the preparation of food known to
expert cooks into which it will not be possible
for us to go here, and for which the reader is
referred to any good cook-book.</p>

<p>Some starchy foods such as rice and potatoes,
do not lend themselves readily to the production
of breads, and are consequently usually
cooked in some other manner. It cannot be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
too strongly insisted upon that they should be
rather <i>steamed</i> than boiled,&mdash;the process being
usually carried out by placing a small
amount of water with them and allowing it to
boil away; we should remember also that the
principles just insisted upon in connection with
making bread apply here with equal force&mdash;we
should cook thoroughly and serve both as
dry as is possible.</p>

<p><i>Cooking of Meats.</i>&mdash;Here again it is necessary
to insist upon the necessity of thorough
cooking. The error has long prevailed that
raw meats are wholesome, but within recent
years it has been clearly demonstrated that this
old view is erroneous. The muscle-fibers that
constitute the bulk of the nourishment of meats
are separated from each other by a substance
which cannot be acted upon by the juices of the
stomach until it has been heated to a temperature
which results in the cooking of the entire
mass. It is true that the muscular substance
proper may be digested without heat&mdash;resembling
in this way the white of the egg, to which
it is chemically closely related; by scraping meat
with some dull instrument the muscle fibers may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
be separated in a more or less pure state&mdash;leaving
the substance that requires heat in order
to become digestible behind&mdash;and after having
been removed in this way, of course, may be
eaten in a raw or semi-cooked condition without
ill effects. In preparing meat it is not absolutely
essential that it be cooked until
thoroughly &ldquo;done&rdquo;&mdash;a slight tinge of red being
allowable.</p>

<p><i>Healthful Recipes.</i>&mdash;In an <a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a> to this
volume will be found a series of recipes for
the preparation of common foods, for which
the author is indebted to Dr. Mary E. Lapham,
of Highlands, N. C. They will be found extremely
practicable for making not only very
palatable but thoroughly wholesome dishes; and
are earnestly recommended to young housewives,
who err through ignorance, as a rule,
rather than because of carelessness or of lack
of good materials. It has often been said that
the road to a man's heart lies through his
stomach. It would not be surprising to learn
that this aphorism fell first from the lips of
some wise woman who had observed that in a
great number of cases unhappiness in home-life<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
had resulted primarily from lack of home-comfort,
and chiefly from unvaried, unappetizing
meals and table-service. Another point is well
worth remembering, especially by young married
women: a man whose home is pleasant and
comfortable is likely to spend as much of his
time there as he can&mdash;if it is otherwise, he will
seek some place that has these desirable qualities,
such as his club, or an arm-chair in some
corner saloon. Furthermore, a man who is not
only abundantly, but <i>nicely</i> fed, has far less desire
for the stimulants which lead to drunkenness,
than the man who is denied at home the
properly cooked and seasonably varied food
which his system craves. No better work in
the &ldquo;Temperance cause&rdquo; can be done than to
make an attractive home.</p>

<p>These are facts which many a young housewife
needs to learn and keep in mind; and it is
for her benefit that Dr. Lapham has prepared
her simple but excellent cooking directions presented
in the <a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>.</p>

<h3>SEVEN AVOIDABLE DISEASES</h3>


<h4>MALARIA FEVER.</h4>

<p>Malaria, in its various manifestations, has
ever constituted the principal obstacle to the
civilization of all tropical and semi-tropical
countries, and as a consequence vast tracts of
the richest and fairest portions of the world
have remained uncultivated and unredeemed
from their primitive savage state. Recent investigations
have shown that this disease can
be easily prevented if the matter is taken up intelligently.</p>

<p>Malaria is a disease produced by a parasite
belonging to the very lowest order of animal
life&mdash;the <i>Plasmodium malaria</i>, which is conveyed
from man to man by that genus of
mosquitoes called the Anopheles. The parasite
attacks and destroys the red cells of the
blood, and produces a poison that causes the
symptoms characteristic of malaria.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Course of the Disease.</i>&mdash;The most common
and well-recognized symptoms of malaria are
those that occur in that variety of the disease
which is known as malarial or intermittent
fever. In this type the patient&mdash;who may or
may not have at intervals for some days
noticed chilly sensations, a feeling of fullness
in the head, and general bodily depression&mdash;is
suddenly seized with a chill followed by a high
fever and subsequent profuse perspiration;
after these symptoms subdue, which generally
requires several hours, the patient returns to
a practically normal condition and feels, on
the whole, well until the next attack occurs.
These chills-and-fever paroxysms occur at various
intervals depending upon the character of
the parasite inducing them, the most common
form being that which produces a chill every
day. In some instances the malady comes on
more insidiously, there being no marked chills
but only periodical elevations of temperature.</p>

<p>In the more chronic forms of the disease the
unfortunate victim is frequently subjected for
years to attacks of fever coming on at irregular
intervals, the patient being more or less of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
an invalid throughout the course of the disease.
In other instances the brain becomes affected,
producing very alarming symptoms; and
in quite a proportion of cases the malady ultimately
terminates in chronic Bright's disease.</p>

<p><i>Treatment of the Disease.</i>&mdash;Most fortunately,
we have in quinine, when properly administered,
a medicine that in practically all instances acts
as a specific in this affection; but it should be
used only on the advice and under the directions
of a physician. In the more chronic
forms of the disease, combinations of arsenic,
with such tonics as nux vomica, iron, and small
doses of some of the preparations of mercury,
produce permanent cures where quinine has
failed. It is of the utmost importance that attention
be given to the treatment, as, so long as
the patient remains with the parasites in his
blood, so long is he a menace to his friends and
neighbors.</p>

<p><i>Mode of Infection Through Mosquitoes.</i>&mdash;The
most brilliant triumph in modern medicine,
and one of the most creditable achievements
of human ingenuity, has been the absolute
demonstration that malaria is carried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
from man to man by means of the Anopheles
mosquito, and that the disease can, in nature,
be produced in absolutely no other way. This
is not a theory, but it is a fact which has been
demonstrated in its every detail beyond dispute,
and we are now happily in a condition to reject
our venerable notions concerning bad air,
miasma, etc.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Before describing the method by which infection
takes place, it is well to say a few words concerning
the mosquito that acts as a carrier of the disease,
which may be easily differentiated from other similar
gnats. The malarial mosquito has a body which is
placed parallel to and almost on the same plane with
the front portions of the insect, and as a consequence,
when at rest on walls or other objects, the back of
the body sticks out almost or quite at right angles
with the surface upon which it is resting. The back
portion of the common mosquito forms an angle with
the front part of its body, with the effect that both
ends of the insect point toward the object upon which
it rests. There are still other differences that clearly
differentiate the malarial from the common mosquito,
but the one given ordinarily serves to distinguish
between them. The malarial mosquito is pre-eminently
a house-gnat, being scarcely ever seen in the
woods or open, but may be found&mdash;oftentimes in
great numbers&mdash;in all malarial localities, lying quietly
during the day in dark corners of rooms or stables.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>This mosquito practically never bites in the day, but
will do so in a darkened room, if a person will remain
perfectly quiet; their favorite time for feeding
is in the early parts of the night and about
daybreak&mdash;all of which accounts for the fact, long
observed, that malarial fever is almost invariably
contracted at night. The malarial mosquito bites
and then goes back to some dark corner where it
remains quiescent for forty-eight hours, at the end
of which time it again descends to feed. Contrary
to the general opinion mosquitoes bite many times,
and frequently remain alive for months&mdash;the malarial
mosquito particularly living in cellars and attics
oftentimes throughout the entire winter.</p>

<p>If one of these mosquitoes bite a person with
malaria, the parasites are sucked in along with the
blood and pass into the stomach of the gnat, making
their way ultimately into the body substance; here
the parasites undergo a series of multiplications, a
single one of them sometimes producing as many
as ten thousand young malarial parasites. After
the parasites have developed fully, which requires
eight days in warm weather, they make their way
to the venom-gland of the mosquito and there remain
until it bites, when they are injected into the
body of the individual attacked along with the poison.</p>

<p>After getting into the human blood, each parasite
attacks a red-blood cell, bores into it, and grows at
the expense of the cell until it reaches maturity, at
which time it divides up into from seven to twenty-five
young parasites which are liberated and each in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>turn attacks a new cell. This process goes on until
a sufficient number of parasites are produced in the
individual to cause the symptoms of malaria, and the
new subject of the disease thereafter becomes a source
of danger to others in the vicinity through the intervention
of still other malarial mosquitoes.</p></div>

<p><i>Malaria Avoidable.</i>&mdash;From the foregoing it
is seen that the proper way to avoid malaria
is so to screen houses that mosquitoes cannot
enter them. Persons in malarial districts
should not sit on open porches at night, and
should be careful to sleep under properly constructed
nets. If this be done, there is absolutely
no danger of anyone ever contracting the
disease. It will be well observed that these precautions
are not necessary in the daytime, as
the malarial mosquito rarely attempts to bite
during this period.</p>

<p>It should be remembered by those who have
the disease that they are a constant source of
danger to people living in the vicinity, and
they should be doubly careful as long as the
disease persists to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes
at night. It is furthermore their duty
to vigorously treat the disease until the parasites<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
are no longer present in their bodies, at
which time they cease to be a menace to others.</p>

<p>Many children have malaria without showing
symptoms, and, if allowed to sleep without
being properly covered with a net, are very apt
to infect a large number of malarial mosquitoes;
the blood of children in malarial localities
should be examined from time to time, and
if the parasites be found, the children should be
given the proper remedies until a cure is effected.</p>

<p>Particular attention should also be directed
to the fact that almost all Negroes in malarial
localities of the South harbor the parasites,
though very few of them show symptoms of
their attacks. It is, therefore, very important
that they be treated properly, and their white
neighbors should see to it, for their own safety,
that they do not sleep in houses unprotected
by nets.</p>

<p>If the precautions herein detailed were properly
carried out, for even a few months, malaria
would practically cease to exist wherever this
was done, and would not recur unless individuals
from other places suffering from the disease<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
were to come into the districts where the
Anopheles mosquito is present, and so give it
to the gnats&mdash;to be by them recommunicated to
humanity.</p>


<h4>TUBERCULOSIS.</h4>

<p>Of all the enemies of mankind, tuberculosis,
in its various forms, takes the first rank. Of
protean manifestations, occurring in almost
every part of the body and producing diseases
of the brain, of the nerves, of the bones, of the
skin, and of all of the internal organs&mdash;pre-eminent
is the terrible malady we call consumption,
which is tuberculosis of the lungs. It has
been estimated that one-seventh of all the people
born into the world die as a result of this
malady in some one of its various forms, and it
is probable that one person out of every three
dying between the ages of fifteen and sixty
years, succumb to this disease. As a result of
the labors of thousands of patient, self-sacrificing
investigators&mdash;many of the most distinguished
of whom have died of this disease
while carrying on their work&mdash;the peculiarities
of this affection are now fairly well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
understood, and if we were to apply the knowledge
which we now possess in our attempts
to free ourselves from its ravages, there is no
question but that within a comparatively short
period of time the disease would practically
cease to exist.</p>

<p><i>Character and Course of the Disease.</i>&mdash;Tuberculosis
is produced by a minute vegetable parasite
known as the <i>Bacillus tuberculosis</i>, a germ
which not only occurs in the human being, but
is widely distributed among the lower animals.
Tuberculosis of the lungs (to restrict ourselves
to this most important manifestation) generally
comes on insidiously, there being usually no
definite period from which the sufferer can date
the onset of the malady. In the early stages
there is usually loss of appetite and a pronounced
feeling of weakness followed by a
slight cough; the latter symptom frequently
leads patients to erroneously believe that their
trouble began with a bad cold, when as a matter
of fact, the catarrhal trouble of the throat and
bronchial tubes was originally produced by the
germs of tuberculosis&mdash;there being no such
thing as a cold changing into consumption. As<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
the disease progresses the patient complains of
fever and chills, these symptoms being oftentimes
periodical, and lead to the belief that the
trouble is malarial fever: this mistake is very
common, and whenever such symptoms appear
a good physician should be immediately consulted.
The patient also suffers from exhausting
night-sweats in many instances, though this
is not invariable. A rapid loss of flesh is one
of the earliest and most common symptoms.
The symptoms above enumerated continue and
grow worse, and in quite a proportion of the
cases there is, in addition, spitting up blood,
which in some instances may be so pronounced
that it becomes a distinct hemorrhage. In the
more rapid or &ldquo;galloping&rdquo; forms of the disease
the patient frequently dies within a few weeks
or a month or so, while in the less severe types
the malady may persist for many years before
death occurs.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;The treatment of tuberculosis
by drugs has proven an entire failure, but a
large number of persons afflicted with this disease
will recover, if placed under proper hygienic
conditions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>The patient should be put on a porch or in
a tent, whether it be winter or summer, and
kept in bed at absolute rest as long as there is
any fever, and should be fed in abundance with
good, wholesome food. While this treatment
appears simple it should always be carried out
under the directions of a physician, as it is
only possible for those having a thorough
knowledge of the subject to give such directions
as would lead to a rapid cure of the patient.</p>

<p><i>Modes of Infection.</i>&mdash;Hereditary tuberculosis,
notwithstanding a popular idea to the contrary,
is very rare, but there is no question
that those persons in whose family tuberculosis
exists are much more prone to contract the
disease than others. In just what manner the
germ of consumption gains entrance to the
human body, we are more or less uncertain, but
there are reasons for the belief that in many instances
they pass in by means of the inhaled
air; there is no doubt that in a small percentage
of cases the bacillus gains entrance to the
body through an abrasion of the skin or of some
mucous membrane; finally the bacteria are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
often taken in with the foods that we eat, or
by putting objects upon which the germs are
present into the mouth, or eating with hands
which have been contaminated and not washed.
Of the foods that contain the germs of consumption,
milk is unquestionably the most common,
as there can be no question that fully 25 per
cent. of our cows have this disease, and under
such circumstances their milk is usually infected
with the bacillus that produces the malady;
meats, likewise, often contain germs of this disease,
but, as they are usually cooked, no harm,
as a rule, results.</p>

<p>Of quite as much importance as the introduction
of the germ into the body is the resisting
power of the individual at the time when this occurs,
since the disease can make no progress unless
the tissues have become susceptible through
lowered resistance. All things then that have
the effect of lowering the vitality of the body
act as predisposing causes to consumption;
such, for example, as <i>WANT OF PROPER
FOOD</i>, <i>LACK OF SLEEP</i>, <i>IMPROPER
CLOTHING IN COLD AND WET
WEATHER</i>, <i>AND LIVING IN DAMP AND</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
<i>IMPROPERLY VENTILATED HOUSES</i>;
excesses, <i>PARTICULARLY THE TAKING
OF ALCOHOL</i>, conduce to the development of
the disease&mdash;long-continued inebriety being beyond
doubt the cause that most frequently leads
to consumption. It is a common error that alcoholic
stimulants tend to ward off consumption,
and it is absolutely certain that these substances
not only do not act in a curative way in those
who have already contracted the disease, but are
positively detrimental. In order then to avoid
consumption&mdash;and this is particularly of importance
for those in whose family there is a
predisposition to the disease&mdash;the individual
should live soberly, should try at all times to
obtain a reasonable amount of good food,
should sleep a sufficient number of hours, and
should be clothed properly, particularly in the
winter. Those who devote their time and
energy to the performance of their work&mdash;being
careful of course not to labor excessively&mdash;are
much more apt to escape consumption than
those who do otherwise. It is particularly of
importance that those who have a tendency towards
consumption should early learn, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
throughout life practice, the habit of <i>BREATHING
THROUGH THE NOSE</i>: if this rule be
followed a large percentage not only of the
germs of consumption, but other bacteria as
well, are filtered out during their passage
through the nose and do not reach the lungs.
Cleanliness is also of much importance&mdash;a bath
taken each morning in moderately cold water being
conducive to health, not only as regards consumption
but other diseases as well. It is of
course necessary that dwelling houses should be
kept thoroughly clean.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Advice to Diseased Persons.</i>&mdash;In all cases where
a person observes in himself, or in those for whom
he is responsible, the symptoms already detailed,
it is his duty to at once consult an intelligent
physician, and if it be found that tuberculosis is
present, every precaution should be taken by the diseased
individual to prevent the further spread of
the malady. <i>IN SUCH A CASE THE SPUTUM
THAT IS CONSTANTLY BEING COUGHED UP
CONTAINS MYRIADS OF THE GERMS</i>, and it is
of the utmost importance in order to prevent other
persons in the neighborhood from being infected that
this <i>SPUTUM BE DESTROYED</i>. The patient
should at all times carry about with him either a
small receptacle into which the sputum can be expectorated,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
or a large cloth which would answer the
same purpose, and in either case the sputum should
be burned; if this be impracticable, it should be
placed in some good antiseptic, such as a saturated
solution of carbolic acid or a 1-to-1,000 solution of
corrosive sublimate in water. The patient's handkerchiefs
should be thoroughly boiled, and his clothing
should receive like treatment. Every precaution
should at all times be observed in order to prevent
the sputum getting onto the furniture or floors, as,
under such circumstances, it quickly dries and being
broken up into small particles is carried by means
of the air to other parts of the house.</p>

<p>The patient should always remember that the
quicker he is placed under proper treatment the more
the chances of ultimate recovery; in the early stages
almost all of the cases of this kind are curable, but
later this is not often accomplished.</p></div>


<h4>TYPHOID FEVER.</h4>

<p>Of all of the infectious diseases prevalent in
the United States, typhoid fever is one of the
most common and fatal. As a result of its
ravages a vast amount of invalidism, suffering
and financial loss is brought about each year,
and a frightful mortality results. It has for
some time been recognized that typhoid fever
is among the most preventable of all diseases,
and if our people would bestir themselves and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
carry out the comparatively simple rules that
are necessary for its prevention, the scourge
would, in a short time, practically cease to exist
among us.</p>

<p><i>Character and Course of the Disease.</i>&mdash;Typhoid
fever, enteric fever, or abdominal typhus,
is an infectious disease believed to be caused
by a specific bacterial germ known as the <i>Bacillus
typhosus</i>. It develops, as a rule, quite
slowly, the first symptoms being loss of appetite,
headache, and a marked fatigue on slight
exertion. These symptoms gradually grow
worse, fever develops, and the patient oftentimes
suffers with chilly sensations; the temperature
gradually rises, and in the course of
from a few days to a week reaches a height of
102 degrees, 103 degrees, 104 degrees, or 105
degrees F. In many cases no symptoms exist
that indicate trouble with the bowels, but in the
severe forms of the disease diarrh&#339;a generally
comes on during the first week and continues
throughout the course of the disease.</p>

<p>During the second week the symptoms above
detailed continue, becoming often more severe,
and there develops great nervousness and delirium.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
About this time there are frequently
observed over the chest, abdomen and thighs,
minute reddish spots resembling flea-bites; these
spots last for a few days and then pass away
and are followed by a fresh crop in other situations.
During this period of the disease inflammation
of the bronchial tubes frequently
comes on, and now and then pneumonia
develops. Bleeding from the bowels is
an occasional highly characteristic symptom of
the second week. When the disease follows a
normal course, the symptoms during the third
week begin gradually to abate; the fever lessens,
and the patient, though much emaciated,
gradually returns to a normal condition.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Unfortunately, however, the disease does not always
pursue this favorable course, for, in quite a
proportion of instances, the symptoms increase in
severity during the second or third week, the patient
becomes profoundly prostrated, the delirium deepens,
and death occurs. The hemorrhage from the bowels,
in some instances, is so severe that death is produced
even in comparatively early stages of the affection.</p>

<p>In many instances, through indiscretion, usually
as a result of eating solid food, patients who are apparently
on the road to rapid recovery, relapse, and
the disease repeats the course already detailed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>It is of importance to remember that now and
then so-called walking cases of typhoid fever occur,
the disease in these instances being characterized by
the fact that the symptoms are so slight that the
sufferer does not feel it necessary to go to bed.
However, in these mild cases, fatal hemorrhage from
the bowels is as frequent as in the severer types, and
as a consequence the patient should receive careful
attention. Moreover, it is of importance to remember
that from this mild form of the affection the most
malignant varieties of the disease may be contracted.</p>

<p>The mortality in typhoid fever varies from five
to twenty per cent., depending upon the character
of the disease and the nature of the nursing and
treatment that the patient receives.</p></div>

<p><i>Modes of Infection.</i>&mdash;It is clear that typhoid
fever is the result of the entrance into the body
of some minute form of germ-life, whether this
be the bacterium generally supposed to induce
the disease or not. This contagion is beyond
question a living something which multiplies
with great rapidity under proper conditions,
and, escaping from the bodies of those infected
with the disease, in one way or another, reaches
other individuals. It is beyond question true
that the virus passes from the body of those infected
by means of the urine and feces, and it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
is likely that the secretions from the mouth and
nose frequently contain the germs that cause
the fever.</p>

<p>As the germs are certainly extraordinarily
minute, a very small amount of any of these excretions
might produce the disease in healthy
individuals if it were to get into their bodies
through water, milk, or any uncooked food, or
if it were to find lodgment about the nose or
mouth, or get upon the hands of other persons.
It should also be remembered that the virus
may easily get upon cooking-utensils, drinking-cups,
bed-linen, and other articles with
which we are constantly brought into close contact,
and that the disease might be transmitted
in this way. It is also true that the malady
may be carried from place to place by insects,
particularly flies; the latter may readily get
enough infectious material upon their legs in
various ways, and then, crawling over the food,
leave the deadly poison deposited upon it.</p>

<p><i>Treatment of Typhoid Fever.</i>&mdash;As soon as
the symptoms appear, a physician should be
called and his directions faithfully and carefully
followed out. Nothing in this disease is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
of more importance than careful nursing, and
it is absolutely necessary that the patient receive
only liquid diet until the physician permits
other food.</p>

<p>Wherever possible then, patients with typhoid
fever should be completely isolated, since, if
this is not done, other members of the family
are almost sure to contract the malady&mdash;a result
which almost everyone has seen who has
had any experience with the disease. Wherever
possible patients should be sent to a hospital,
but where this cannot be done they
should be placed in an outhouse, if practicable,
or in an isolated room, which should be
thoroughly disinfected after the patient's recovery.
No one should visit a typhoid-fever
patient, except when compelled to do so, and we
should be particularly careful to prevent children
from coming in contact with them, as it
has been shown that they contract the disease
much more readily than grown people. It is
also of importance that persons should not sit
for any length of time in the sick room, and,
above all, under no circumstances, should cooking
and eating be done there. The room in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
which the patient is placed should be furnished
only with those things absolutely necessary, and
it is particularly desirable that carpets and curtains
should be removed. It is well to wash the
floor each day with some antiseptic solution.</p>

<p>Those persons who come in contact with typhoid
fever should wear outer clothing which
can be easily washed and boiled. After touching
the patient, or any of his clothing, the
hands should be at once thoroughly scrubbed
in an antiseptic solution. Of course, under no
circumstances, should the nurse eat or drink
from the same vessels that the patient does.</p>

<p>None of the excretions from persons afflicted
with typhoid fever should ever be emptied until
thoroughly disinfected with creo-carboline or
strong lime-water, and under no circumstances
should these be poured out in the neighborhood
of springs or wells. Towels, handkerchiefs, and
clothing that comes in contact with the patient
should be thoroughly disinfected before being
sent to the laundry. This is best accomplished
by thorough boiling, but in cases where this can
not be at once carried out, it is advisable to
use some chemical antiseptic; of these, perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
the best is creo-carboline, which may be employed
in a 1-500 solution in water; where this
solution is not obtainable, a 5-per-cent. solution
of carbolic acid in water will answer. It
should also be remembered that the water in
which typhoid-fever patients are bathed necessarily
becomes infected, and this should always
be thoroughly disinfected before being emptied.
These precautions should be carried out for
some time after the patient has recovered, as it
is well known that persons, under such circumstances,
for some time frequently contain the
poison in their evacuations.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>After the patient recovers, the room should be disinfected
with formaldehyde gas obtained from the
substance known as &ldquo;formalin.&rdquo; This gas may now
be obtained from the formalin without the use of
heat in the following manner: When everything is
ready, and the room properly sealed, thirteen ounces
of permanganate of potash to each quart of formalin
are placed in a large vessel, the room being closed
immediately after the two substances are put together;
it is important that the permanganate be
placed in the vessel first. When this method is employed
a quart of formalin should be used to each
one thousand cubic feet of air-space in the room.
As the gas, by this process, comes off with great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>rapidity, it is not necessary to keep the room closed
more than about four hours. This method is to
be advised for the reasons that it acts more quickly
than the older one, and there is never danger of fire.</p>

<p>In cases where houses are too open to permit of
disinfection by means of gas, the sick chamber should
be thoroughly washed with a solution of corrosive sublimate,
carbolic acid or some other good disinfectant.</p></div>


<h4>HOOK-WORM DISEASE.</h4>

<p>It has been only recently recognized that a
large percentage of the invalidism and a great
number of the deaths yearly in the southern
portion of the United States are caused by a
very small intestinal parasite known as the
<i>Necator americanus</i>, or hook-worm. This parasite
has unquestionably existed over the area
just named since the advent of the Negro&mdash;recent
investigations having shown that the worm
is in all probability of African origin. This
hook-worm disease is probably the most common
of all the serious diseases prevalent in the
South, and as it is easily curable, and can be
readily prevented, there is no matter which
should be of greater interest to the people in
the infected regions, especially those who live
in villages or on farms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Character of the Disease.</i>&mdash;The animal parasite
called hook-worm closely resembles, externally,
the pin-worm which so often occurs in
children. The female, which is larger than the
male, measures somewhat more than half an
inch in length, and has the thickness of a knitting-needle;
the male is between a quarter and
three-eighths of an inch in length as a rule.
The parasite possesses around its mouth a row
of minute plates somewhat resembling hooklets,
by means of which it grasps hold of the mucous
membrane of the intestine and bruises it sufficiently
to cause the blood to flow; with this
blood the parasite nourishes itself. At the same
time the worm injects into the tissues a poison
which has much to do with the symptoms that
occur in the disease that it produces.</p>

<p>These worms are usually present in great
numbers, there being as a rule from 500 to
2,000 of them, and as they unquestionably live
at least eight or ten years, the unfortunate
victim suffers for a long period of time as a result
of their presence. While living in the intestines
the females lay enormous numbers of
eggs which pass out with the feces, and under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
suitable conditions of temperature and moisture
there develops within each of them, within
from two to three days, a minute snake-like
embryo which bursts through the shell of the
egg and passes into the neighboring earth.
Here the embryos live for considerable periods
of time, and, ultimately, may infect other individuals,
or those from whom the eggs were
passed. There are at least two ways by which
these embryos gain entrance into the human
body. Some do so by getting into drinking-water
and being swallowed; but, extraordinarily,
they most frequently penetrate through
the skin. When this happens the parasite, in
passing through the skin, produces the disease
known as &ldquo;ground-itch.&rdquo; The vast majority
of the victims of this affection are children
with whose skin the embryo comes in contact
while they go barefooted during the summer
months.</p>

<p><i>Course of the Disease.</i>&mdash;Having entered
through the skin, the embryos of the hook-worm,
moving by a circuitous route finally reach the
intestines, and, grasping hold of the mucous
membrane with their saw-like teeth, they begin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
to suck blood and grow until they reach
the size of the adult worm in about a month
or six weeks. Depending upon the number
which have gained entrance, and the susceptibility
of the individual, there now begins
to develop symptoms of profound an&aelig;mia;
the skin of the child becomes very pale,
and assumes a sort of yellowish hue, and in
cases where there is a severe infection, the
victim begins to suffer with shortness of breath
and dropsy. When this occurs the patient
sometimes dies, but more commonly death
results from contracting some other disease,
which, under ordinary conditions, would produce
no serious results. One of the most unfortunate
effects of this malady is that when
children become infected they cease to grow,
and frequently retain the appearance of early
youth even after they have reached full maturity
in years. These unfortunates are generally incorrectly
regarded as dirt-eaters. The symptoms
frequently last over a period of many
years, as in the intestines of these victims the
worms that originally infect them live certainly
eight or ten years, and during this period<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
it is beyond question true that additions to the
original number are frequently received.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis and Treatment.</i>&mdash;There is no disease
that can be diagnosticated with more ease
and certainty; the eggs are present in the feces
in great numbers, and by means of a microscope
they can always be detected. In all cases
where the disease is suspected, a half-teaspoonful
of the feces of the person supposed to be
infected should be placed in a bottle and sent
to a competent microscopist for examination.
This is done free of charge at the laboratories
of most State Boards of Health in those parts
of the country where the malady exists. Whenever
an individual shows the symptoms above
detailed, an intelligent physician should at once
be called. We have medicines that act as
specifics, and the disease can always be cured
in a very short period of time.</p>

<p><i>Preventive Measures.</i>&mdash;Of course the best
method of preventing this disease is to administer
to those already infected the proper
medicines, and cause the expulsion from the intestines
of the worms that lay the eggs.</p>

<p>The indiscriminate scattering of the feces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
around the stables, so very common in many
districts, should be absolutely forbidden.
Around the house where individuals have lived
who have the disease every care should be
taken to prevent contact with the earth in the
neighborhood of places where the ground might
have become infected. It would be advisable
for children and others to wear shoes for at
least a year after the last individual having the
disease was cured; and as a precautionary
measure it should be insisted upon that properly
constructed privies or water-closets should
be at every house, and that they should be used
by everyone in whom there is a possibility that
the disease exists.</p>


<h4>DIPHTHERIA AND ITS TREATMENT.</h4>

<p>Loeffler's discovery in 1884 of the germ of
diphtheria, and its relation to the disease of the
same name, established the specific infectious
nature of this malady, and demonstrated beyond
a doubt that membranous croup is not ordinarily
an independent affection, but is almost
always simply diphtheria of the wind-pipe.
The discovery of antitoxin, some time later, reduced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
the mortality of diphtheria from an average
of 30% to 10% in ten years; its use has also
shortened the course of the disease, and decreased
greatly the frequency of the paralytic
conditions that not uncommonly follow this
malady.</p>

<p><i>Character and Course of Diphtheria.</i>&mdash;Diphtheria
is an affection caused by a bacterial microbe
which produces a poison that acts locally
upon the tissues invaded, and also, as a result
of its introduction into the general circulation,
brings about more or less profound effects on
the entire system.</p>

<p>The period of incubation is from two to ten
days. The onset is generally characterized by
a rise of temperature from 100&deg;F. to 104&deg;F.,
chilliness, headache, and pain in the back and
limbs. Albuminuria is common. The glands of
the neck often become swollen. In mild attacks
a slight sore throat is all that is complained of.
In the majority of cases the disease attacks the
throat and tonsils, and is characterized locally
by the appearance of a membrane, which is usually
gray or yellowish-white, elastic, and adheres
tightly to the surface upon which it lies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
At times, however, the membrane is soft and
pliable, and is easily separated from the tissue;
such cases are frequently diagnosticated as follicular
tonsillitis. A bad cold is occasionally the
only symptom of the disease. The diagnosis
should always be confirmed by bacteriologic examination.
In some instances the wind-pipe is
primarily attacked, but when the disease affects
this part of the throat it is generally a consequence
of the extension of the membrane downward
from the region of the tonsils. In the former
case the diagnosis is somewhat difficult, as
cultures taken from the throat may not show
the presence of diphtheria bacilli, though material
that is coughed up may contain myriads of
the germs; in this phase of the disease interference
with respiration is the symptom most
to be feared. The mucous membrane of the
nose, eyes, ears and generative organs, may be
affected. Wounds are also liable to become infected
with this organism. In rare instances
the membrane may extend down into the bronchial
tubes and lungs, and has been found on
post-mortem examination covering the inside of
the stomach.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>As complications we may have broncho-pneumonia,
acute Bright's disease, inflammation of
the internal structures of the ears, bleeding
from the nose, inflammation of the valves of the
heart, and sometimes paralysis of this organ,
with death; the last named sequel of diphtheria
comes on during convalescence, usually from
two to four weeks after the subsidence of local
symptoms, and is due to inflammation of the
nerves that control the heart. Much less commonly
paralytic conditions of the palate, throat,
eye muscles and the nerves of taste occur, and
under rare conditions, paralysis of the lower
extremities. Paralysis of some kind follows in
from ten per cent. to fifteen per cent. of the
cases, and appears with equal frequency after
the mildest as well as following the most severe
cases.</p>

<p><i>Mode of Infection.</i>&mdash;The germs of diphtheria
may be carried in articles used by persons with
the disease, or they may be communicated by
direct contact. The micro-organism is found in
the secretions from the mouth, throat, or nose,
and in particles of detached membrane. Bedding,
utensils, etc., used in the room where a patient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
has diphtheria, are liable to carry the
germs if taken from the sick-room, and consequently
should be always properly disinfected
before being removed. Milk-bottles carried
into the sick-room, or handled by persons caring
for the patient, should never be returned to
the dealer without being disinfected. Cats,
and less frequently dogs, may contract the disease
and convey it to those with whom they
come in contact. Unrecognized mild cases are
a frequent means of spreading the disease, as
also is a too early release of patients after recovery.
It is a much safer method of procedure
to require at least two negative examinations
before releasing a patient from quarantine,
as during convalescence the germs may be
entirely absent on one day and a few days later
be quite abundant. The bacilli may remain in
the throat from a few days to several years
after the disease is apparently entirely well, and
under such circumstances the persons carrying
them become quite as great, if not a greater,
menace to those with whom they came in contact
as they were during the height of the disease.
A thorough disinfection of the room and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
everything used about the sick person should
be carried out after the patient is released.
Complete isolation should be observed during
the illness, and as long as the bacilli remains in
the throat.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;Diphtheria antitoxin is the specific
treatment of this malady, and should be
given early in the disease. The chances of recovery
decrease in proportion to the length of
time existing between the onset of the affection
and the time of administration of the drug.
Antitoxin may be repeated in six hours after
the initial injection if improvement is not noticed,
but ordinarily twenty-four hours should
elapse between doses. It is well to remember
that it is safer to give too much antitoxin than
too little. The initial curative dose varies from
2,000 to 5,000 units, according to the age of the
patient and the severity of the disease. When
a case is seen late it is often advisable to begin
with a large dose,&mdash;it being good practice under
such circumstances to use at once as much as
10,000 units or even more. The average case
requires from the beginning to the end of the
treatment a total of from 10,000 to 20,000 units,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
but occasionally 50,000 or even 100,000 units
may be necessary. There are very few risks in
giving antitoxin. In a series of 50,000 cases
treated with it only two deaths occurred sufficiently
early after the injections to warrant the
belief that this unhappy result was produced by
the drug. It is worth remembering that asthmatic
cases bear the administration of antitoxin
very poorly; a marked and sometimes serious
embarrassment of respiration, with cyanosis,
unconsciousness, and general collapse may follow
its use, but recovery is usual in such cases.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A condition known as anaphylaxis or hypersensitiveness,
which at present is being much studied, may
sometimes occur in the human being. This hypersensitiveness
is manifested by the extraordinary peculiarity
that any number of doses of antitoxin may be
given provided they are administered within a period
of less than ten or twelve days. On the other hand
a single minute dose may induce this state after the
period named, and, as we never know whether a patient
is going to develop it or not, it becomes a question
as to the safety of giving a second injection after
ten or twelve days have elapsed following the administration
of the initial treatment. As it is true that
this hypersensitiveness once established in animals
may continue throughout life, it becomes a question
as to whether or not it is quite safe to administer antitoxin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
to an individual who has had the drug given
him at some prior time, and we are not as yet in a
position to definitely determine the risks that are involved
in such a procedure. There is no reason to
doubt that this hypersensitiveness is much less marked
in man than in the lower animals, and there can be
no question that it much less commonly develops, but
notwithstanding this it would be the part of prudence
to avoid a second administration of the drug after the
interval referred to in all instances where this seems
possible. Anaphylaxis is thus seen to bear an important
relationship to what is commonly called the
&ldquo;immunizing treatment&rdquo; to prevent diphtheria,
which consists in giving a moderate dose of antitoxin
to a person immediately after exposure to the disease.
Under such circumstances a degree of immunity is
undoubtedly secured, but this passes off in the course
of a few weeks, and the patient then becomes just as
susceptible as he was before. Should he now contract
diphtheria, we would be confronted with the possibility
that the treatment by means of antitoxin might
possibly produce serious and even fatal results.</p>

<p>Occasionally rashes occur several days after the inoculation,
but such disturbances are insignificant except
for the immediate discomfort experienced. Antitoxin
concentrated by the Gibson method has reduced
to a considerable extent the number of cases in which
rashes occur.</p></div>

<p>Treatment other than by antitoxin is symptomatic.
Where the disease occurs in the wind-pipe,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
it may be necessary to pass a tube into its
upper opening to allow the patient to breathe,
and in other instances the wind-pipe is itself
opened from the outside in order to permit a
sufficient amount of air to enter the lungs to
maintain life.</p>

<p>It is of the utmost importance that patients
be kept in bed until all danger of complications
has passed. Death from heart-failure several
weeks after the diphtheria in the throat is well,
is not an uncommon result of the disease, and is
especially prone to follow even the slightest exertion.
Patients under such circumstances
have been known to die from raising themselves
up in the bed.</p>


<h4>CEREBROSPINAL MENINGITIS.</h4>

<p>Meningitis, or spotted fever, is one of the
most terrible and fatal of all diseases, every
case proving fatal in some local epidemics.</p>

<p>Although the cause of the disease has been
known for a number of years, the exact method
by which the germ that produces it spreads
from man to man was until quite recently entirely
unrecognized, and even now it cannot be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
said that the whole matter has been demonstrated.</p>

<p><i>Character and Course of the Disease.</i>&mdash;Cerebrospinal
meningitis is produced by a minute
vegetable (bacterium), the <i>Micrococcus intracellularis</i>.
This germ does not appear to occur
normally in any of the lower animals, nor
has it been found in the outer world, and is
therefore to be regarded as distinctly a human
parasite. It is very fortunately a germ of low
vitality, as it develops only at about blood heat,
and when expelled from its normal dwelling-place
in the human body it dies very quickly.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The accompanying illustration shows how these
bacteria appear under the microscope; the drawing
was made from fluid taken from the spinal canal
of a patient suffering from cerebrospinal meningitis.
These germs get within the skull and spinal canal,
and produce violent inflammation of the coverings
of the brain and cord; these membranes are called
&ldquo;meninges,&rdquo; hence the name &ldquo;cerebrospinal meningitis.&rdquo;
Within a short time after their entrance pus
is produced, and the condition becomes practically
one of abscess around the brain and spinal cord.</p></div>

<p>In almost all cases the disease is preceded by
a slight catarrhal condition of the nose and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
throat, the symptoms being those of an ordinary
cold. The symptoms that point to the covering
of the brain being attacked come on with great
suddenness; there is usually a chill, followed by
intense headache, vomiting, restlessness, with
great dread of noises and bright light; in many
cases reddish spots appear beneath the skin,
and these are usually tender on pressure. In
some cases the muscles of the neck become
very stiff, and contract so that the head is
drawn backward. The temperature is somewhat
irregular, but is always above normal in
the beginning, and sometimes goes very high;
the pulse as a rule is normal, or but little accelerated.
After the patient remains in this condition
for a period varying from a few hours to
several days, he generally becomes unconscious,
and in a comparatively short time dies. In
some cases the symptoms after starting off very
violently quickly subside, and the patient makes
a comparatively rapid recovery. In other instances
the disease begins more mildly, the patient
having more or less of the usual symptoms,
but not so severely as is ordinarily the case; in
such cases the patient may die, after lingering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
weeks or months; or may make a protracted recovery,
frequently with partial paralytic conditions
that permanently remain.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Unfortunately we possess no specific for this disease.
Recently there has come into vogue a treatment
by a serum supposed to have antitoxic power against
this disease, but its exact value is, as yet, by no means
settled; it must be used early if any good is to be
expected from it. In addition to the antitoxin all
that can be done is to keep the patient quiet with
anodynes, and to minister to his comfort in every way
possible. Ice applications to the head sometimes alleviate
the intense headache. As the disease is practically
an abscess around the brain and cord, perhaps
the most rational treatment would be to open up the
skull and let the pus drain away.</p></div>

<p><i>Mode of Infection.</i>&mdash;As this disease is one
that is due to a specific germ it is obvious that it
cannot exist without the presence of this organism;
the malady is therefore infectious, and
must necessarily be to a certain extent contagious,
notwithstanding the fact that it is generally
thought not to be so. The reason that the
affection has not been thought to be contagious
may be explained by the following facts: Recent
investigation has shown that in many, if
not all, instances of this disease, the germ may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
be found in the nose and throat, where, as has
already been explained, it sets up a condition
resembling an ordinary cold. In all probability
the infection takes place in the nasal cavity
first, and the germ ultimately finds its way to
the coverings of the brain. Now there is every
reason to believe that in many, and probably in
a great majority of instances, the germ goes no
further than the mucous membrane of the nose,
and the patient merely has as a consequence
what he considers an ordinary cold. It is clear,
however, that if another individual, who was
very susceptible to this germ, should contract
the disease from this person, he might have the
meningeal form of it. In other words, it is probably
true that the vast majority of people who
are attacked by this organism simply get colds
as a consequence, and only now and then does a
person get meningitis as a result. This explains
why the disease does not ordinarily appear
contagious.</p>

<p>The facts above stated are of much importance
in combating the spread of this disease.
People who are exposed to those having meningitis
should be exceedingly careful not to get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
upon their persons any of the secretions that
come from the patient, and during periods of
epidemics those who observe a bad cold coming
on should promptly consult their physicians,
and do everything to prevent the development
of all catarrhal conditions in their noses.</p>

<p>During epidemics persons with colds should
be very careful not to allow other people to
become infected from them. As cold and wet
are undoubtedly predisposing causes to colds
it is well for everyone to shun such exposure
during periods when meningitis is prevalent;
debilitating influences, such as alcoholic excess
and lack of sleep, should also be avoided.</p>


<h4>HYDROPHOBIA.</h4>

<p>This disease, as it occurs in man, is practically
always conveyed by the bite of some animal,
the dog being the usual offender. The poison is
present in the saliva of the diseased animal
and is transmitted through wounds made by its
bite.</p>

<p>As observed in the dog, there are two types
of the disease,&mdash;one the &ldquo;furious,&rdquo; the other
the &ldquo;paralytic.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>In the furious type</i> the animal first appears to
be restless and somewhat excited. He seeks dark
places and apparently prefers to be by himself. In
this stage of the disease the dog's appetite is good
and may be excessive; he responds to orders although
his attention can be attracted only for a moment at
a time. As the malady progresses the animal becomes
more and more restless, and develops a desire
to tear those things about him into pieces. There
is described a peculiar bark at this stage of the disease;
instead of ending as it ordinarily does, it is
prolonged and terminates in a higher pitched note
simulating a cry. This is supposed to be very characteristic
at this stage of the affection. The appetite
gradually diminishes, food is refused, and swallowing
becomes difficult. As the symptoms gradually
progress the dog shows signs of delirium and
begins to wander. As a rule, he goes about with his
tail hung, mouth wide open, and with a wild look in
his eyes, biting as he goes, anything that happens to
be directly in his path; seldom does he turn aside
to disturb anything or anybody. In the later stages
of the disease paralysis generally develops, beginning
in the hind legs and soon involving the body. If
the animal be now carefully observed it will be seen
that he cannot swallow. There is no dread of water,
as the name &ldquo;hydrophobia&rdquo; implies, and as is commonly
thought, the animal often attempting to drink,
but owing to the paralysis of the muscles of the
throat this is impossible. Inability then to swallow
either water or solid food is one of the surest and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>most reliable signs of rabies. Weakness becomes very
marked, and the animal finally lies down in a stupor
and dies. The entire course of this type may last
from six to ten days; generally it is four or five.</p>

<p><i>The paralytic type</i> of the disease occurs in fifteen
or twenty per cent. of the cases. The onset is, as a
rule, the same as that observed in the furious type.
Instead, however, of the dog beginning to wander,
as previously mentioned, the animal becomes paralyzed,
the paralysis first affecting the muscles of
the jaw, later of the tongue. As is the case in the
furious type of the disease, the animal loses the power
to swallow both solids and liquids, but has no fear
of water. The mouth remains wide open, the tongue
protruding, and an abundant amount of thick saliva
exudes. The animal remains quiet, does not attempt
to bite any animal or individual. Death occurs on
the second or third day of the disease.</p></div>

<p><i>Precautions.</i>&mdash;When an individual is bitten
by an animal either supposed or known to be
rabid, the wound should be immediately cauterized
with some caustic, preferably concentrated
nitric acid. This should be applied without
fear because it is safer to use too much than
too little. In case this is not available any
strong caustic may be used. Punctured wounds
should be laid open with a knife and the surfaces
freely cauterized. It should not be forgotten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
that the slightest scratch from the tooth of a
rabid animal may lead to the development of
hydrophobia in man, and it therefore behooves
all persons bitten by dogs to take every precaution
possible. Even though the animal at
the time may appear to be healthy, some strong
antiseptic should be applied to the wound,
and the animal carefully watched until all possibility
of his having the disease has passed.
Many persons have died from slight wounds
inflicted by animals appearing at the time to
be perfectly well.</p>

<p>Attention should also be directed to the fact
that wounds where the teeth of the animal pass
through the clothing are not so dangerous as
those where no such protection intervenes.
Bites about the face and head are much more
frequently followed by rabies than those inflicted
on the extremities, and, of course, where
wounds are deep the chances of infection are
much greater; where injuries of the latter kind
are inflicted it is practically out of the question
to thoroughly cauterize them, and the patient
should immediately receive the Pasteur treatment.
It is probable that if thorough cauterization<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
be not done within five minutes that it cannot
be relied on to prevent the development of
the disease; where there is any doubt the only
safety lies in the Pasteur treatment. Where
a person is bitten by a dog supposed to be rabid
the animal should be caught, if possible, and
kept carefully isolated for at least ten days;
should it appear well after the expiration of
this period no fear need be felt as to the results
of its bite, but if it should die the head should
be cut off, packed in ice, and sent to some
laboratory for examination.</p>

<p><i>Under no condition should the animal be
killed, as the best possible proof of the harmlessness
of its bite would lie in its continuing to live.</i></p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;Since the epoch-making researches
of Pasteur, laboratories have been installed
in various parts of the world for the
purpose of making a vaccine by means of which
it is possible, by gradual immunization, to prevent
the development of hydrophobia in persons
bitten by rabid dogs. This is done by a series
of injections of a weak virus prepared according
to the directions of Pasteur. <i>It should always
be remembered that no harm can come</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
<i>from the treatment whether the patient was bitten
by a rabid dog or not, and that in all cases
of doubt no hesitation should be felt in resorting
to it.</i></p>

<h3>HYGIENE OF THE SICK ROOM</h3>


<p>Far too little attention is generally accorded
to the proper care of the sick,&mdash;the prevailing
opinion being that the royal road to recovery
under the circumstances is opened up only
through the taking of drugs, and that provided
the appropriate ones be given in sufficient quantities
recovery will result. No greater mistake
is possible. As a matter of fact, there are very
few diseases for which we have medicines that
act in a specific manner, and far more is usually
to be hoped for from good nursing. Fortunately
the general public is beginning to recognize
the truth of the statements just made.
It has only been a short time since the trained
nurse was unknown except in the larger medical
centres, but now her presence and beneficent
influence is being felt from one end of the
land to the other, and her importance is destined
to increase with the onward march of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
time; she is undoubtedly the greatest advance
that we have made in medicine during the last
decade.</p>

<p>Where persons are ill they should always be
attended by a trained nurse if possible, but if
this is out of the question a few suggestions as
to the sick room and its hygiene should certainly
not be omitted from any book dealing with rural
sanitation.</p>

<p><i>Ventilation and Warmth.</i>&mdash;The sick room if
possible should be located on the sunny side
of the house, and should have fire in a fireplace
if the weather be cold. It is of the utmost consequence
that the room have windows and doors
by means of which it can be at all times thoroughly
ventilated. At all seasons of the year a
room on the lowest floor of the house is more
satisfactory, since it is warmer in the winter
and cooler in the summer. The room should
not be uncomfortably cold, though it is much
better to have the temperature too low than to
have the air stuffy. In most diseases ventilation
is of supreme importance, and should be
secured at any cost. Where, however, it is
compatible with thorough ventilation, a temperature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
of about 70&deg;F. is generally considered
most desirable.</p>

<p>Before a patient is moved into a room all
superfluous furniture should be taken out, particularly
carpets and hangings of all kinds. It
is likewise of the utmost importance that all
insects, particularly flies, be excluded by proper
screening.</p>

<p>The patient's bed should be narrow, and a
mattress is much to be preferred to a feather
bed. The mattress should be protected by a
rubber sheet or newspaper pads; oil-cloth
cracks and wrinkles too badly to be of service
for this purpose. The rubber sheet should of
course be kept under the sheet nearest the mattress.
The cover should consist of a sheet
which is long enough to fold back at the head
over the other covering for some distance, and
blankets should be used for warmth in preference
to quilts. The bed should be kept scrupulously
clean, and the linen and covering should
be removed when soiled. The nurse should see
to it that bread-crumbs do not remain in the
bed.</p>

<p>In removing soiled bed-clothes the following<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
plan is the one usually adopted. The patient
is moved to one side of the bed as near the edge
as possible, and the sheet beneath him loosened
at the head and the foot and on the opposite
side; it is then rolled up toward the patient and
pushed well up under him, leaving the side of
the bed opposite to that upon which he is lying
bare; upon this the new sheet is placed, which
is then tucked under the edges of the mattress,
and the patient rolls or is pulled back over on it.
The soiled sheet is then removed and the edges
of the fresh one pulled over the portions of the
bed still uncovered, and secured in the usual
way.</p>

<p><i>General Precautions.</i>&mdash;The room should also
be kept scrupulously clean; all sweepings
should be burned. Soiled linen and all excretions
from the patient should be promptly removed,
and if the latter need not be preserved
for the inspection of the physician, should be at
once disinfected and properly disposed of.
Milk and other food should not be left in the
sick room; and soiled glasses and dishes should
be removed and washed at once in boiling water.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>Persons who are ill should not be allowed to
have company. There is nothing more important
in connection with the looking after patients
with infectious diseases than this precaution.
The writer has often seen in the country
districts patients with typhoid fever and other
infectious diseases surrounded by the neighbors
from miles around,&mdash;the entire company often
eating and drinking in the room occupied by the
afflicted person. The strain that results on the
patient from a practice of this kind might well
in many cases have fatal consequences, and
there is no question whatever that many diseases,
particularly typhoid fever, are scattered
in this way from house to house and from one
community to another.</p>

<p>The diet should be given regularly and should
consist strictly of only such things as are allowed
by the physician.</p>

<p>All medicines should be given absolutely according
to directions, as otherwise having a doctor
is worse than useless.</p>

<p>All patients should have a daily bath, special
attention being given to their hair, teeth, mouth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
and nails. In many cases it is necessary to
wash the patient's mouth frequently with some
antiseptic wash. This should only be done on
the expressed instructions of the doctor.</p>

<h3>EMERGENCIES AND ACCIDENTS</h3>


<p>Few things are of greater importance, and
nothing is more neglected than instructing
school-children how to act in emergencies.
Particularly is such knowledge of value in the
country. In cities the need of understanding
matters of this kind is not so great, since it is
usually possible to secure at short notice some
one capable of dealing with any situation that
may arise. Children very quickly grasp knowledge
of this character, and opportunities frequently
offer for an actual demonstration of
the proper remedies in the case of accidents.
When the instructor speaks of cuts and burns
they at once understand what is meant.</p>

<p>The most serious result of our neglect in
this particular is that our children pass through
life with the most meagre knowledge of the
proper way in which to meet accidents of all
sorts, for where they are not taught during<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
their school days they, for the most part, remain
ignorant of matters of this kind throughout
their maturer years. It is much to be hoped&mdash;though
this is somewhat of a digression&mdash;that
the old unscientific and senseless system of
teaching, which persists even in the present
time to a considerable degree, may in the future
give way to a more rational and practical plan
of instruction&mdash;one that will deal with perceptible
needs rather than abstractions.</p>

<p>The most common emergencies will now be
taken up and considered in detail.</p>

<p><i>Drowning.</i>&mdash;The subject of drowning is one
of especial interest in rural districts, since it
is here that accidents of this kind are most apt
to occur, and skilled attention is most difficult
to obtain. It is of the utmost importance to
remember that people may be resuscitated after
having been under the water for considerable
periods of time, and we should, therefore, look
upon no ordinary cases as hopeless until the
proper restorative measures have failed.</p>

<p>On removing the body from the water we
should not waste time by attempting to drain
the water from the victim's mouth, as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
amount of this substance that enters the air-passages
under such circumstances is so trifling
that it may be entirely disregarded. The
drowned person should be placed face down
upon the ground with the head slightly turned
to the left, and we should begin at once with
artificial respiration.</p>

<p><i>Artificial Respiration.</i>&mdash;This is accomplished
by the operator kneeling between the separated
legs of the patient and placing his hands on the
small of his back, the thumbs nearly meeting at
the middle of the spine, and the other fingers
spread out over the lower portion of the chest;
the operator then sways his body downward
and forward slowly, counting three during the
movement, then quickly swinging backward releasing
the pressure on the patient's chest;
again count three and repeat the original movement.
The pressure should be brought to bear
from twelve to fourteen times a minute, and
the movement should be kept up until the patient
begins to show evidences of being restored,
or until it is quite evident that life is extinct.</p>

<p>This system of artificial respiration was originated
by Professor Schafer, as the head of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
commission appointed by the British Government,
and is now universally regarded as being
by far the most satisfactory of all such methods.</p>

<p>In the accompanying figures are shown the
positions assumed by the patient and operator
while carrying on artificial respiration.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that the victims of
accidents of this kind suffer considerably from
lowering of the temperature of the body as a
consequence of the long exposure to water, and
we should, therefore, also direct our attention
toward bringing about an immediate reaction
by means of warm blankets and hot bottles, and
by vigorous rubbing of the patient's body.</p>

<p><i>Danger from Wounds.</i>&mdash;Wounds may be produced
by a great variety of objects, but chiefly,
of course, by cutting instruments. Where they
are caused by duller objects, producing more or
less tearing and bruising of the tissues, they
are more apt to be followed by infection with
disease-producing germs than where smoothly
cut, and consequently require greater care in
treatment. Germs sufficient to produce death
may be introduced into the body by the most
minute wound; it is for example well known<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
that fatal consequences have resulted from the
bites of various insects, and the writer has personally
seen a case where a pin-prick was followed
by lockjaw and death. Such facts teach
us that we should be careful in avoiding wounds
of all kinds, and, that after they have been received,
they deserve attention, however insignificant
they may appear to be.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Wounds resulting from objects more or less covered
with dirt are particularly dangerous, since under
such circumstances the germs of lockjaw are apt to
be introduced into the body, and fatal consequences
not uncommonly ensue. It is astonishing how frequently
the disease just referred to follows where a
barefooted child sticks a dirty splinter or a rusty
nail into its foot, and it cannot be too strongly urged
that it is the duty of the parent in such instances
to call in a competent physician at once. The reason
that injuries of this kind are so apt to be followed
by lockjaw is that the germ that produces the
disease lives practically everywhere in the earth&mdash;being
especially common in the rich soil of gardens
and other highly fertilized earths; and the germs
are so minute that thousands of them might be present
on the point of a pin without being visible to
the naked eye. The bacilli of lockjaw do not grow
at all where exposed freely to the oxygen of the
air, and as a consequence of this fact we rarely see
the disease that they produce developing after slight
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>superficial wounds; much more commonly the malady
results from a wound made by some penetrating object,
such as a splinter of wood, a nail, or a pin.</p>

<p>The lesson that these facts teach is that where
wounds are small and deep it is the part of wisdom
to cut them open freely in order that they may be
cleansed as far as is possible, and at the same time
allow the air to obtain free access to their deepest
portions; a wound of this kind should not be sewn
up, but should be left open and allowed gradually
to heal up.</p>

<p>The reason why lockjaw so frequently follows
wounds from the premature explosion of fireworks
is that the paper used in fire crackers, etc., often
contains the germs of the disease and is driven
deeply into the tissues. In view of the very considerable
mortality that yearly occurs among the
children of this country it seems incomprehensible
that our legislatures&mdash;which commonly exhibit such
an uncontrollable desire to regulate their neighbors
in every possible way&mdash;should not long ago have
placed the ban on fireworks of all kinds.</p></div>

<p><i>Treatment of Wounds.</i>&mdash;The treatment of
wounds necessarily depends to a considerable
extent on their character and general severity:
there are certain practices, however, that apply
in all cases, and should, therefore, be resorted
to wherever injuries of this kind occur. Where
the wound is superficial the bleeding is as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
rule trifling in character, and very quickly stops
of its own accord. In other cases, particularly
where deep, larger blood-vessels may be severed,
and if they be of any considerable size,
the hemorrhage will not cease until the subject
becomes exceedingly weak, and in some instances
the bleeding will go on until death results.
Where bleeding is profuse, it may generally
be assumed that one of the larger vessels
has been cut, and under such circumstances it
should be compressed until skilled assistance
arrives. There is a popular but very erroneous
impression that arteries can only be stopped by
tying; as a matter of fact any one possesses
sufficient strength in the fingers to pinch them
enough to stop the hemorrhage. If possible,
the operator should get his finger down into the
wound, after which he can quickly discover the
exact point where pressure stops the bleeding.
One who is unaccustomed to surgical practices
would, of course, hesitate at doing this, but it
cannot be too strongly urged that a procedure
of this character produces little or no pain after
the finger is first introduced, and that no one
should be deterred by foolish squeamishness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
from immediately doing that which in many instances
can only save the life of the victim.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Where arteries are evidently bleeding&mdash;which may
be inferred from the spurting character of the hemorrhage&mdash;a
tight bandage above the seat of the wound,
if on one of the extremities, will often be followed
by a cessation of the bleeding, and where only small
vessels are cut, a bandage tightly applied over the
wound itself may accomplish a similar result. Under
such circumstances the reader should be warned
that it is not safe to leave a limb tightly bandaged
in this way for any considerable length of time, as
complete death of the part below may result. Where
then a ligature is placed above or over a wound, it
should be loosened cautiously every twenty or thirty
minutes, and should be left off for a time. If the
wounded artery begins to bleed, one should resort to
local pressure upon it with the finger for five or ten
minutes, after which the bandage may again be applied.</p></div>

<p>As soon as all bleeding has ceased, the wound
should be thoroughly washed out by means of
water that has been boiled and allowed to cool;
the operation may be greatly assisted by using
a rag or a piece of cotton that was boiled in the
water. If there be grease or other dirt that
does not readily come away soap may be freely
used.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>After the wound has been thoroughly
cleansed, some sort of antiseptic had better be
applied. Unquestionably the best of all of
these is tincture of iodine, a small amount of
which should be poured directly into the wound.
A saturated solution of carbolic acid in water
is also a fairly good disinfectant, and may be
employed where the tincture of iodine cannot
be obtained. A solution of corrosive sublimate
in water&mdash;one part of the former to one thousand
parts of the latter&mdash;is much used as an
antiseptic by surgeons, but when placed directly
in wounds has a tendency to cause much irritation,
and is by no means so efficient as either of
the disinfectants just referred to. In the
country it is an old custom to use turpentine,
or resins from several different species of
pines; these are fairly efficient antiseptics, and
should be employed where it is impossible to
obtain those that are better. It should always
be remembered that thorough washing out
with boiled water and soap is in itself a procedure
that will remove a considerable proportion
of any germs that may have got into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
the wound, and that if carefully done, it is almost
as efficient as the best antiseptic.</p>

<p>After the wound has been thoroughly
cleansed by water and antiseptics, it should
then be bandaged with a cloth that has been
previously boiled and dried, if no regular surgical
dressing is at hand. Every precaution
should then be taken to prevent it being reopened.
Collodion is sometimes used over
small wounds, and is quite efficient in that it
forms a coating over any surface upon which
it is placed that is impermeable to both air
and water. Small wounds that have been
thoroughly cleansed and disinfected with tincture
of iodine may be safely and satisfactorily
closed by means of the substance just
mentioned, but it should never be forgotten that
the germ of lockjaw&mdash;which is the one, ordinarily,
most to be dreaded in such injuries&mdash;lives
and grows best in the absence of the
oxygen of the air, and that a covering of collodion
would materially assist in the development
of this dreadful disease.</p>

<p>In those instances where pus forms in
wounds, they should be at once reopened and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
allowed to drain. It very often follows after
cuts&mdash;particularly if they be not properly
cleansed&mdash;that a scab forms on the outside,
holding beneath a greater or less amount of pus.
The presence of the latter can generally be inferred
by a wound presenting a red and angry
appearance around its edges, and from swelling
and pain. As soon as such a condition is
observed, the scab should be thoroughly soaked
in water and removed, and it is then necessary
that the wound be kept open and allowed to
drain freely until it heals up from the bottom.
A failure to observe precautions of this kind
may result in blood-poisoning, and finally even
in death. After a wound begins to suppurate
it does little good to put antiseptics into it,
as they cause considerable irritation, and under
no circumstances do they put an end to the pus
formation. Open drainage of the wound, and
keeping up the general health of the patient,
are the only means that we possess of successfully
combating conditions of this kind.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as we possess an antitoxin that unquestionably
has the power of preventing lockjaw,
if given sufficiently early, it is the part of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
wisdom to administer at once a sufficient dose
of this substance to any child who has received
a penetrating wound from some dirty object, or
from the explosion of fire-crackers. Statistics
show that under such circumstances lockjaw
may be prevented in almost all cases. If we
wait until the disease develops, the antitoxin is
of no value.</p>

<p><i>Care of Sprains.</i>&mdash;The seriousness of sprains
is very generally underestimated, and as a consequence
many persons go through life with
ankles that are abnormally weak, and even
painful in bad weather, and in which there is a
tendency to swell and become exceedingly
troublesome after a slight wrench. In all true
sprains there is more or less actual tearing of
the ligaments that bind the joint together, and,
if the injury be not properly treated and the
joint thoroughly supported, complete recovery
in many instances never takes place.</p>

<p>As soon as a sprain occurs the injured joint
should be immersed in water just as warm as
can be borne, and hot water should be from
time to time added in order to keep the temperature
sufficiently high. The bath should be continued<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
for several hours&mdash;the longer the better.
Thus the pain and swelling will be greatly reduced,
and the tenderness which, in the beginning,
is so excruciating, will largely disappear.
The next step is to properly support the injured
parts in order that unnecessary movement may
be prevented, thus avoiding further tearing of
the ligaments. This may be accomplished by
means of various splints&mdash;the most popular being
those made of plaster of Paris, or silicate of
sodium, either of which will require the services
of a physician in order to have them
properly applied.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Within recent years a treatment has come much
into vogue, which is exceedingly satisfactory, and
has the advantage that it does not require the service
of an expert in order to have it properly carried out.
This consists in the application of strips of adhesive
plaster to the skin over the seat of the injury and
for some distance both above and below the joint
affected. Ordinary sticking-plaster is not the best
for this purpose, though in an emergency it might
be used; much better is the so-called mole-skin plaster,
which is much thicker, and does not require
moistening before being applied. The plaster should
be torn into strips about three-fourths of an inch
wide and twelve to eighteen inches long. Where the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>ankle is the seat of the trouble, a strip is firmly applied
to the back of the foot, beginning just behind
the toes, and is brought around the ankle and carried
up on to the calf of the leg&mdash;thus partially
winding the plaster around the leg. The first strip
having been applied, another is put on in a similar
way, the edges of the latter overlapping those of
the former. This is continued until one side of the
ankle is fairly well covered, after which we may
begin operations on the opposite side, carrying the
strips around the leg in such a way as to meet and
overlap those first put on. This process is continued
until the entire joint is completely covered with the
plaster. It is of the utmost importance that the
foot be put in a natural position before we begin to
apply the plaster, as, otherwise, it will be left in a
constrained and uncomfortable position, which will
do away largely with the good effects of the splint.
Where carried out in the proper way it is in the
highest degree astonishing to see how perfectly the
joint is supported, with the effect that the use of
the injured limb may be immediately resumed. The
writer recalls having seen a young lady with a frightful
sprain, who could not bear to touch her foot to
the floor, improve to such an extent under the treatment
as outlined that she was able to go to a ball
and dance through the evening on the day the injury
occurred.</p></div>

<p>Not only does the immediate resuming of the
use of an injured limb, when treated in this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
way, appear not to be injurious, but the ultimate
recovery seems actually hastened. After
a day or so it is well to remove the plaster splint
first applied and put on another, as the former
has by this time usually ceased to fit the injured
joint&mdash;owing to the diminution in the
swelling. The splint may be changed three,
four, or even five times, if deemed necessary,
though two or three applications generally
amply suffice. <i>This or some other splint
should be kept on the injured joint for at least
a month or six weeks, as otherwise complete recovery
frequently fails to occur, with the permanent
weakening of the joint as a consequence.</i></p>

<p>Of course it is always desirable to have a
physician apply the splints for a sprain where
this is feasible, but with a little care it may be
done by any intelligent person who will observe
closely the directions given. The plaster should
be put on moderately tight, but the utmost
care must be exercised in not carrying this to
an extreme, as in such cases serious results
might ensue. In order that it may be determined
as to whether or not the splint is too
tight, it is advisable to watch the patient's toes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
for some hours after the plaster is put on, and
should they be found to be very cold, and particularly
should they begin to show a dusky discoloration,
it is evidence that the strips are exerting
too much pressure, and they should be
at once removed. Under such circumstances, in
a half an hour or so, the splint could be reapplied
with safety.</p>

<p>The mole-skin plaster, which is used in making
the splint just referred to, may be obtained
in rolls of any width from all druggists; and as
the plaster keeps practically indefinitely, it
should be in the medicine-closet of everyone
living at a distance from skilled medical aid.</p>

<p>After a sprained ankle the patient should
wear shoes that come well up above the injured
joint, and they should be laced tightly until
some time after all symptoms of trouble have
disappeared; it would be on the safe side to
wear shoes of this kind from six months to a
year, depending upon the severity of the injury.</p>

<p><i>Treating Bruises.</i>&mdash;Bruises are not usually
followed by serious consequences if properly
treated. They result from injuries that tear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
the tissues beneath the skin to such a degree
that hemorrhage from many minute blood-vessels
occurs in the injured part. In the course
of a few hours they often present a truly alarming
appearance, being swollen and greatly discolored,
but they are not as a rule followed by
any permanent ill results. Where bruises are
slight no treatment of any kind is required, as in
a short time the effused blood is absorbed, and
the part returns to a normal condition. Where
more severe it is not a bad practice to cover
them with flannels wrung out from hot water,
the same being renewed from time to time, and
the applications kept up for from six to twelve
hours. Usually at the end of this time the
soreness and swelling will have considerably
abated, and the injured tissues quickly return to
a normal condition.</p>

<p><i>The reader should be warned that under no
circumstances should the skin be opened, even
though it may be quite obvious that there is a
bluish mass of blood immediately beneath.</i>
Where this mistake is made, infection of the injured
tissues with the germs that produce pus
inevitably results, and as a consequence the patient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
suffers with a discharging wound for a
considerable period of time. In rare cases
germs get into the injured parts without the
skin having been opened, and there results
under such circumstances a condition which
closely resembles that of an ordinary abscess.
The probability that this undesirable complication
has arisen is shown by the swelling becoming
greater and more painful some days after
the injury has occurred, and under such circumstances
a good physician should be at once consulted,
as it will be necessary to make an incision
into the diseased area.</p>

<p><i>Soothing Burns.</i>&mdash;One of the most common
and painful of injuries are burns. Small superficial
burns require no particular treatment.
Where, however, they are of sufficient severity
to merit attention, the simplest and best of all
treatments is to immerse the diseased part in
cold water, and here it should remain at least
some hours, or until competent medical aid can
be secured. Medical treatment of injuries of
this kind is not particularly satisfactory,
though there are some drugs that may be used
with more or less benefit. Chief among them is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
picric acid, which may be applied by means of
a cloth wrung out of a one per cent. solution of
this substance in water. Another treatment
which has some merit, and which has long enjoyed
a certain vogue among both medical men
and the laity, is a combination of equal parts of
lime-water with either olive or linseed oil; this
is called carron oil and is applied in the same
way as the picric acid solution. All three of
the remedies referred to act largely by preventing
the access of air to the burned surface, and
they, therefore, may be replaced by any bland
and non-poisonous substance which accomplishes
like results.</p>

<p><i>Accidents from Heat and Cold.</i>&mdash;The climate
of the United States is characterized by extreme
variations&mdash;there being over almost its
entire extent during the winter months a series
of &ldquo;cold waves,&rdquo; during which excessively low
temperatures are often experienced,&mdash;particularly
in the northern and western portions of
the country. During the summer, on the other
hand, we have almost everywhere periods during
which the temperature goes very high&mdash;often
accompanied by excessive atmospheric<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
moisture. As a consequence of these extremes
in temperature it could only be expected that
we would often experience bad effects, so that
serious illness, and even death, occasionally result.</p>

<p>Of the two extremes, excessive heat is much
the more dangerous, and is by far more frequently
followed by fatal results&mdash;particularly
in crowded cities. Fortunately for the dwellers
in rural districts the precise conditions under
which excessive heat is followed by serious consequences
are not so frequently encountered as
in the more populous centers, and as a result
we find that serious ill effects from high temperatures
are by no means so common in the
former as in the latter. There are, however,
two quite well defined and distinct morbid conditions
that are the result of high temperatures,
and inasmuch as they differ in their symptoms
as well as in their treatment, it will be
necessary to consider them separately.</p>

<p><i>Sunstroke.</i>&mdash;Sunstroke is characterized by a
rapid onset, the patient usually complaining of
an uncomfortable sense of burning heat and a
feeling of dizziness and depression. Nausea,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
vomiting, and diarrh&#339;a are common, frequently
an intense headache, and sooner or later a muttering
delirium. The patient's skin is dry and
hot, the face is flushed, and the eyes suffused,
and a thermometer will show a bodily temperature
of from 105&deg; to 110&deg; or even 112&deg;F. In
fatal cases it is usually some hours before the
patient dies, though sometimes he succumbs
almost instantly.</p>

<p>When attacked, the patient should at once be
removed to some shady place, and should be
held in a sitting posture against any suitable
object that may be at hand. The clothing
should be loosened at once, and every endeavor
should be directed towards lowering the temperature
of the victim. This is best done by
pouring ice-water or the coolest water that can
be secured freely over the entire body of the patient.
This treatment should be continued until
the temperature approaches the normal&mdash;the
vigor of the measure employed gradually decreasing,
as the patient shows signs of getting
better. Improvement is shown by a gradual
return of consciousness.</p>

<p><i>Heat-Prostration.</i>&mdash;Like true sunstroke, heat-prostration<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
comes on with an extreme suddenness.
The patient becomes suddenly dizzy, and
sinks to the ground in a state of collapse. The
skin is pale and cool, the pulse limp and weak,
and the thermometer shows the temperature to
be somewhat below normal. The patient should
be laid on the ground in a cool, shady place,
and stimulants at once given. By far the most
efficient of them is a hypodermic injection of
morphine and atropine, to which strychnine in
appropriate doses may be added.</p>

<p><i>Guarding against Sunstroke and Heat-Prostration.</i>&mdash;Excessive
heat is the basis of both of
these conditions, but there are many contributing
causes which play a more or less important
part in their production. Notwithstanding
the fact that they are regarded as being
different, and that the treatment and symptoms
of the two conditions vary widely, there
can be no doubt that certain depressing influences,
in every way similar, play an important
part in their causation.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Foremost among such influences alcohol claims
first place, and unquestionably not only predisposes
to all diseases brought on by heat, but lends much
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>greater gravity to an attack&mdash;the drunkard rarely
recovering from true sunstroke, and frequently dying
from the much less dangerous heat-prostration.
It is said that the latter condition is particularly
prone to occur after freely indulging in beer or other
malt liquors. Not only does alcohol predispose to
these morbid states, but other influences that depress
the general vitality are more or less apt to predispose
to the production of both, such as loss of sleep,
overwork, worry, excessive eating, and insufficient
food. The danger is greater when there is excessive
moisture in the air, so that at such times we should
particularly avoid excesses of all kinds, and as far as
possible, keep out of the direct rays of the sun.</p></div>

<p><i>Frost-bite.</i>&mdash;In the extreme northern and
northwestern portions of the United States
frost-bite is not uncommon in winter. The part
attacked becomes suddenly bloodless, presenting
much the appearance of the skin after
death. The victim is usually not aware of the
fact as at first there is no pain. As soon as a
condition of this kind is observed,&mdash;and in cold
countries persons are quick to inform the victim
when they notice it,&mdash;the place should be
vigorously rubbed with a piece of ice, or with a
handful of snow, and this should be continued
until the circulation again returns as evidenced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
by the parts becoming reddened. A rapid
warming of the affected parts is not advisable,
the result being not unlike that of a burn.</p>

<p><i>Chilblains.</i>&mdash;Many persons suffer during the
winter from chilblains&mdash;this being a state in
which more or less pain and itching is produced
in a part as the result of poor circulation.
Such a condition is usually the result of
a combination of cold with the affected part
being more or less compressed, and as a consequence,
we find that troubles of this kind are
more frequently in the feet&mdash;particularly where
tight shoes are worn. The remedy for troubles
of this character is to wear loose-fitting shoes,
and to thoroughly protect the parts by appropriate
woolen socks. It is particularly of importance
to change the socks often, since as
soon as they become moistened with perspiration
a tendency to a recurrence of the trouble
is very great. Drugs are of no particular use
in conditions of this kind. Chilblains are more
commonly suffered in Europe than in America.
One young American lady in Paris acquired
them one winter, and &ldquo;knowing no better,&rdquo; as
she told the writer, cured herself by &ldquo;boiling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
the chilblains&rdquo;&mdash;soaking her feet in the hottest
water she could endure. The affliction did
not return; and the novel recipe was delightedly
followed by all the art-students of
the neighborhood.</p>

<p><i>Blisters.</i>&mdash;Small blisters on the feet are not
uncommon as the result of wearing tight, or ill-fitting
shoes. Wherever possible, they should
be quickly relieved from all compression, and
should under no circumstances be opened.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The treatment is very simple and quite efficient,
provided it be instituted while the skin is still intact,
and consists simply in placing over the affected
area a small piece of mole-skin plaster, which should
extend for a short distance out on the normal skin
surrounding the blister; the same sort of plaster
should here be used as was recommended for supporting
sprained joints, and is an article so useful
that it should be kept in every house. Where blisters
have ruptured, the better plan is to apply some
antiseptic, like tincture of iodine, and after having
allowed it to dry, stick on some plaster as already
directed. If no antiseptic be at hand the plaster
should be used any way, but it should be frequently
removed in order to see that no suppuration is
occurring beneath. Small blisters, the result of
burns, may be treated in a similar way with good
results.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span><i>Tooth-ache.</i>&mdash;Tooth-ache is a condition for
which there is no excuse in the present state of
knowledge. As soon as decay begins in a tooth
it should receive the attention of a competent
dentist, and where this is done a true tooth-ache
never occurs. Where one has been so neglectful
as to permit the exposure of the nerve
of a tooth, he can only be saved from much suffering
by going at once to a dentist. In the
meantime, various measures may be adopted
to diminish the pain. A piece of cotton dipped
in dilute carbolic acid and thrust into the cavity
will almost immediately relieve the suffering
for the time being. Oil of cloves, or a mixture
of this substance with chloroform, applied in
a similar way will bring about a like result.
The reader cannot be too often reminded of the
fact that bad teeth not only cause much suffering,
but likewise lead to many digestive disturbances,
and as a consequence little could be
of more importance to the health of the body
than to see to it that they be kept in perfect
order. Where teeth are knocked out, they will
often grow back and render good service for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
many years afterwards if replaced immediately
in their sockets.</p>

<p><i>Bites of Animals.</i>&mdash;Wounds of this character,
particularly those produced by dogs and cats,
are not at all uncommon. Where it is definitely
known that the animal is not rabid, the
treatment should be that of punctured wounds,&mdash;to
the chapter on which the reader is referred
for further information.</p>

<p>Where there is reason to suspect that the
animal has hydrophobia, it should be, if possible,
at once confined, and watched for developments.
Under no circumstances should it be
killed. If the animal is rabid, it will be unable
to eat or drink, and will die in the course of a
few days; should it survive not the least fear
need be felt as to it having had hydrophobia, as
no instance is on record where the disease was
followed by recovery. For further information
on this subject, the reader is referred to
the special article on hydrophobia (<a href="#Page_211">page 211</a>).</p>

<p><i>Hiccough.</i>&mdash;Hiccough is a condition caused
by a spasm of the diaphragm. All methods for
the relief of this somewhat annoying condition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
are based upon the idea of having the patient
hold his breath as long as is possible. The
remedy is best applied by the sufferer holding
his breath and leaning as far backward as is
possible, and in the meanwhile distracting the
attention by pointing the index finger of one
hand towards the nose, and bringing the former
toward the latter as slowly as is possible.
Sticking the tongue out and holding the breath
at the same time will often relieve hiccough,
or if the victim can be induced to sneeze the
distressing symptom will at once cease. The
<i>slow</i> swallowing of a few sips of water will frequently
put an end to the trouble.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h3>WHAT TO DO WHEN POISONED</h3>


<p>The vast majority of cases of poisoning occur
in children, and are, almost without exception,
due to carelessness of their elders, and therefore
preventable.</p>

<p>As soon as it is recognized that anyone has
swallowed a poison of any kind, a competent
physician should be summoned with the utmost
haste, and in the meantime much may be done,
in most cases, to minimize the effects of the
substance taken. The patient should at once
be urged to drink as much water as is possible,
in order that the poison may be diluted, and
every effort should be made to induce vomiting;
this may often be brought about as soon as the
stomach is full of water, by tickling the throat
with the finger, or with any other object that
can be readily introduced through the mouth.
As quickly as possible, some warm water<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
should be secured, to a quart of which either
a teaspoon of salt or mustard should be added,
and the patient urged to drink until the stomach
is thoroughly distended; following this, particularly
where aided by tickling the throat,
vomiting may be generally induced, with the
effect, of course, of expelling a greater or less
proportion of the poison from the stomach. If
it be known that the poison is an <i>acid</i>, ordinary
cooking soda should be added to the water that
the patient drinks, as in this way all acid substances
are at once neutralized.</p>

<p>If the patient has taken an <i>alkaline</i> poison,
he should immediately be given diluted vinegar,
or water into which the juice of lemons or
oranges has been squeezed; such harmless acids
neutralize poisonous alkaloids just as harmless
alkalies antidote poisonous acids.</p>

<p><i>Arsenic poisoning</i> usually results from the accidental
swallowing of rat-poison or some insecticide,
as Paris green, or else some sort of
green dye, many of which contain salts of arsenic
in some form. An emetic should be at once
given, to be followed by the whites of several
eggs dissolved in a small amount of water;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
sweet milk may also be administered with benefit.</p>

<p>Accidental poisoning by <i>phosphorus</i>, results
usually from children eating the heads of
matches, and it is rarely the case that enough
of the substance is taken to produce serious results.
The poison, however, is a deadly one if
taken in sufficient quantity, and where it is
found that substances containing it have been
swallowed the most energetic measures should
at once be resorted to. Warm water containing
mustard or some other emetic should at
once be given, and this should be followed by
whites of eggs and sweet milk. It is well also
to try to get rid of any of the phosphorus that
might remain in the stomach by giving the patient
some saline purgative like Epsom salts.</p>

<p>Where <i>carbolic acid</i> has been taken, the fact
can be readily determined by noting the characteristic
smell of this substance on the patient's
breath, and by observing that the mouth
and throat present a more or less whitish appearance.
The treatment to be of any avail,
should be of the most energetic character. The
patient should at once drink largely of water,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
and vomiting should be induced as quickly as
possible. Either milk or the white of an egg
should then be given. Ordinary quick-lime, or
even plaster from the walls of the house, may
be stirred up in water and administered to the
sufferer, as both have a distinct value in antidoting
the effects of this poison. Burns of the
skin with carbolic acid are rarely followed by
serious consequences. As soon as the accident
occurs the part should be thoroughly washed
with water, and if at hand a little alcohol may
be rubbed over the part; the affected tissues
return to a normal condition in the course of a
short time in the vast majority of cases.</p>

<p><i>Strychnine poisoning</i> is comparatively rare,
except when this substance is given with suicidal
or murderous intent. Water should be
given, immediately followed by an emetic. A
mass of crystals of permanganate of potash
as big as a pea may be administered in a glass
of water, if this substance be at hand. After
the poison has been absorbed nothing is usually
of any avail if the amount was originally
sufficient to produce death.</p>

<p>One of the commonest forms of poisoning is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
from <i>opium</i> in the form of morphine, paregoric
or laudanum. When this happens the stomach
should be washed out by water frequently, even
where the drug was administered hypodermatically.
This is best accomplished by causing
vomiting by warm water to which a small
amount of mustard has been added. The patient
should be given strong coffee or tea at
frequent intervals, and artificial respiration
should be practiced. Where it is possible to
obtain it, permanganate of potash in a watery
solution should be given, enough of the chemical
being used to make the water a deep purple
color; this may be frequently repeated, as the
substance is not poisonous in ordinary doses,
and destroys morphine and other alkaloids of
opium very rapidly.</p>

<p><i>It should never be forgotten that infants and
children are poisoned by comparatively very
small doses of opium, and consequently nothing
containing any derivative of this substance
should be given them except on the advice of a
competent doctor.</i></p>

<p>Many soothing syrups advertised for the relief
of the minor ailments of children contain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
opium, and there can be no doubt that many
deaths have occurred as a consequence of taking
such nostrums.</p>

<p><i>Mushroom poisoning</i> in this country is relatively
rare, but there are quite a number of
popular notions on this subject that are totally
incorrect, chief among which is the idea that
there is a difference between mushrooms and
toad-stools, the former being generally regarded
as edible, and the latter poisonous. As
a matter of fact, those conversant with this
subject make no distinction between the two,
using the terms toad-stool and mushroom as
interchangeable. It is likewise a common error
to suppose that we possess any tests by
which the poisonous toad-stools can be told
from those that are wholesome. Although a
skilled student of the subject can almost at
a glance determine which are poisonous and
which are not, it is hazardous in the extreme
to consume those selected by one who is inexperienced.
As a matter of fact, for all practicable
purposes, there is only one species that is
generally eaten,&mdash;the <i>Agaricus campestris</i>, or
meadow mushroom. This grows for the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
part in open fields, and in many parts of the
world may be gathered in great number throughout
the warmer seasons immediately following
rains. This mushroom has also the great advantage
that it is the only one of the edible
species that can be cultivated.</p>

<p>Just as we have only one common mushroom
that is ordinarily eaten, there is only one common
species of these plants that is highly
dangerous,&mdash;the <i>Amanita phalloides</i>, which contains
one of the most deadly poisons known&mdash;and
one for which we possess no adequate
antidote. This mushroom is very common, being
frequently seen along the roadside, and at
the edges of fields; it also grows in forests, and
is occasionally encountered in treeless areas.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It presents a rather attractive appearance, being
rather large, and having a glistening white cap with
a long stem, around which there may always be seen
a distinct collar; on carefully removing the soil
from around its roots, it will be seen that its stem
is surrounded just below the surface of the earth
by a sheath-like structure, the so-called &ldquo;death-cup,&rdquo;
which, together with the peculiarities already mentioned,
clearly stamp this mushroom as being one
of the most deadly of all known natural objects.
In addition to the rather inviting appearance of this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>toad-stool, its flavor is agreeable, thus in every way
insidiously inviting, it would seem, the unwary to
their doom. Less common than the species just considered
is another closely related fungus known as
the <i>Amanita muscarius</i>, or fly-agaric; this handsome
mushroom presents the same peculiarities of structure
exhibited by the <i>Amanita phalloides</i>, but differs from
it in the fact that the tip of its cap is scaly, and is
of a reddish-yellow color. The fly-agaric is quite as
poisonous as its more common relative, and is equally
to be shunned. The reader should be warned that
even handling either of the fungi just considered
may result in poisonous symptoms&mdash;probably as a
consequence of multitudes of the tiny spores of the
plants being carried into the nose and mouth by the
air.</p></div>

<p>Some hours after eating the <i>Amanitas</i>, the
patient is taken with vomiting, diarrh&#339;a,
cramps, and extreme prostration; in children,
convulsions may occur. Most unfortunately
evidences of this poisoning do not usually develop
until some hours after eating it. As a
consequence, a considerable amount of the
poison has usually been absorbed into the body
before the victim is aware that anything is
wrong, and it, therefore, becomes impossible, as
a rule, to greatly help matters by attempting to
remove the offending material from the stomach<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
by emetics. Notwithstanding this it would be
proper to administer warm water, into which a
small amount of mustard had been stirred, in
order to assist nature by washing out of the
stomach whatever portions of the fungus might
remain. When exhaustion begins to appear, it
should be combated with doses of aromatic
spirits of ammonia, and by the external application
of heat. As it is believed that atropine
possesses some antidotal powers to the poison
of the <i>Amanitas</i>, this substance should be injected
hypodermatically in the usual dose as
quickly as possible, and an experienced physician
should be called at once.</p>

<p><i>Ivy Poisoning from Touch.</i>&mdash;One of the two
species of <i>Rhus</i>, is exceedingly common in all
portions of the United States, producing a
severe inflammation of the skin when handled,
or even in some persons by merely being near
the plants or in the smoke of a fire where they
are burning. There are two varieties of the
<i>Rhus toxicodendron</i>, one being the shrub commonly
called <i>poison oak</i>, and the other a climbing
vine generally known by the name of poison
ivy. The <i>Rhus venenata</i> grows in swampy localities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
all over the United States, and is
known as poison-sumac, swamp dog-wood,
poison-elder, and poison dog-wood. About
twenty-four to forty-eight hours after the exposure,
the skin begins to itch, and this is
shortly followed by an inflammation accompanied
by the formation of numerous small
blisters, and still later by scaling. It should
not be forgotten that the berries and other portions
of these plants are poisonous when taken
internally, giving rise under such circumstances
to vertigo, faintness, dilation of the pupils,
trembling, confusion of the senses, and, in some
instances, convulsions. Should it be discovered
that anyone has been exposed to poisoning by
these plants, the skin should be washed as
quickly as is possible with alcohol, or some substance
like whisky that contains it; where this
cannot be obtained, hot water and soap should
be liberally applied&mdash;the object, in either case,
being the removal of as much of the poison as is
possible. After the irritation of the skin has
begun, the parts may be bathed in a one per
cent. solution of carbolic acid, to be repeated
every few hours, as the necessities of the case<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
may demand. Lead-water is also frequently
used with benefit, lime-water also appears to be
of use, but the various powders and salves sold
in stores rarely help the patient much. The
best thing after all is soap and water as hot as
it can be borne; and ordinarily the itching and
inflammation will disappear in four or five
days, followed by scaling.</p>


<h4>VENOMOUS SNAKES AND SNAKE BITES.</h4>

<p>Much popular misapprehension exists on
the subject of snakes, both as to the results
of their bites and the appropriate treatment
under such circumstances. It is not generally
understood that a very large percentage of our
American snakes are entirely harmless&mdash;the
poisonous ones being decidedly more the exception
than the rule.</p>

<p>Within the confines of the United States there
exist only two families of venomous serpents.
By far the most numerous are three genera of
viperine snakes, including the rattlesnakes and
moccasins; all of these have a pit-like depression
between the nose and eyes, and hence are
called <i>pit-vipers</i>. In the southern portion of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
our country there are two species of a colubrine
genus closely related to the dreaded cobra of the
East, one of them being called the coral-snake
or harlequin snake, and the other, which occurs
in the southwest, is known as the Sonoran coral-snake.</p>

<p>While there are three genera of vipers in
America, two of them are so closely related, and
present characteristics that are so similar that
the ordinary observer would regard them as being
identical, and inasmuch as the character of
their poison seems in every way similar, for
practical purposes it would seem desirable to
include them under one head; in both genera,
the species have rattles on the tips of their tails,
the more common being the ordinary rattlesnakes
(genus <i>Crotalus</i>), of which there are
twelve species in the United States, and the
ground-rattlesnakes (genus <i>Sistrurus</i>), of which
there are two species.</p>

<p>Closely related to the rattlesnakes are the true
moccasins, of which there are two species, one
being the cotton-mouth or water-moccasin
(<i>Ancistrodon piscivorus</i>), and the other the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
highland moccasin, pilot-snake or copper-head,
(<i>Ancistrodon contortrix</i>).</p>

<p>The two species of poisonous colubrine serpents
already referred to are known respectively
as the <i>Elaps fulvius</i>, and the <i>Elaps euryxanthus</i>,
both of which occur in the southern portions
of the United States. These snakes are
fortunately of a very mild disposition, and
rarely attempt to bite, even when handled. That
their poison is exceedingly deadly is attested by
the fact that out of eight instances where it was
known that persons were bitten by them, six
died, and they should, therefore, be looked upon
as among the most deadly of North American
serpents. Mention should be made of the fact
that there are at least six harmless reptiles that
resemble the coral-snakes very closely, and as a
consequence of the former being mistaken for
the latter, the assertion has been frequently
made by the ignorant that our elapine serpents
are harmless.</p>

<p>A short description of the really deadly reptiles
encountered in this country that would
enable even the novice to distinguish them from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
those that are harmless would seem not inappropriate
here, for where a person is bitten by
a snake it becomes at once a matter of vital importance
to determine, if possible, its true character.
Most non-venomous serpents will viciously
bite when cornered, and while they may
produce slight wounds, with a small amount
of bleeding, such injuries are entirely devoid
of danger, and need occasion no fear on the
part of the victim. There now follows a brief
description of our venomous snakes, by means
of which it will be easy for any one to distinguish
them from their innocent relatives.</p>

<p><i>True Rattlesnakes.</i>&mdash;There are twelve species
of these reptiles in the United States, all
of which, with but two exceptions, live west of
the Mississippi. They vary very greatly in
color, but the common eastern forms generally
have alternate transverse yellow and brownish-black
marks over their bodies. All possess rattles.
The body of the snake is thick in proportion
to its length, and the head, which is more
or less diamond-shaped, is much larger than,
and is quite distinct from the neck. The pupils
of the eye are elliptical&mdash;a peculiarity which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
the pit-vipers alone possess of all the North
American snakes. Between the eye and nose
there is a comparatively deep depression or pit
which gives to this group of snakes their name.
There are two large, exceedingly sharp fangs
in the front of the mouth, in the position of a
dog's canine teeth, that are folded up against
the roof of the mouth when the snake is in repose;&mdash;being
brought forward in a position for
stabbing as the serpent strikes. The scales on
the under surface of the body back of the anus
do not divide along the middle line into two
rows, as in harmless snakes.</p>

<p><i>Ground Rattlesnakes.</i>&mdash;There are two species
of the pygmy or ground-rattlesnakes. They attain
to a length of only about twenty inches,
and present the general characteristics of the
true rattlesnakes, with the exception that the
rattle is small, consisting of but one single button
at the end of the tail. These serpents are
exceedingly vicious, and usually bite without
warning. Contrary to the general opinion, however,
the wounds they inflict are rarely, or never,
followed by serious consequences in man. One
species is southern. The other occurs from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
Ohio to Nebraska, where it is called massasauga.</p>

<p><i>Cotton-Mouth Moccasin.</i>&mdash;The largest specimens
of the cotton-mouth moccasin attain to a
length of about six feet. The full grown reptile
is of a dingy brownish-black color, but the
young are pinkish, with coppery bands running
transversely across the body. With the exception
that this reptile has no rattles, it answers
in its general peculiarities to the description
already given of its near relatives the rattlesnakes.
The cotton-mouth moccasin is semi-aquatic,
being found around the edges of
streams and other bodies of water.</p>

<p><i>The Copper-head, or Highland Moccasin.</i>&mdash;This
serpent is found from Florida and Illinois
to southern Massachusetts; also in parts of
Texas. The largest specimens have a length of
about three feet. They resemble the cotton-mouth
moccasin in their general peculiarities,
being, however, somewhat lighter in color. The
head has a coppery tinge, from which the snake
gets its name, while the body is of a brownish
color, with transverse Y-shaped bands of reddish-brown.
Its favorite habitat is rocky hill-sides<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
and the banks of mountain water-courses.</p>

<p><i>Coral-snakes.</i>&mdash;The two coral-snakes resemble
each other very closely, and are long
slender serpents, whose heads are quite small,
and scarcely differentiated from their bodies.
The pupils are round, and the head has no pits.
They possess two short permanently erect
fangs, which are by no means so well developed
as those of the viperine reptiles&mdash;though perhaps
capable of inflicting more deadly wounds
than any of the latter,&mdash;with the possible exception
of the diamond-back rattlesnake of the
extreme southern portion of the country. Their
coloration is exceedingly beautiful, and when
properly interpreted, entirely characteristic.
From the head to the tail their skins exhibit alternate
rings, or encircling bands of black, red
and yellow&mdash;each band of the two former colors
being bordered by yellow; <i>in other words there
are as many yellow stripes as there are both
black and red together</i>. Stress is laid upon the
characteristics just mentioned, for the reason
that half a dozen species of harmless serpents
that greatly resemble them may, without exception,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
be differentiated from the true coral-snakes
by the fact that there are as many <i>black bands
as both red and yellow</i>. Where a snake has been
killed, it is of course quite easy to determine
whether or not it is venomous by a search for
the fangs, which are never present in the non-poisonous
reptiles. Fortunately, the coral-snakes
are only found in the extreme southern
portion of the United States, live under ground
for the most part, and are rarely encountered.</p>

<p><i>Treatment of Snake-Bite.</i>&mdash;As soon as a person
has been bitten by a poisonous serpent, a
tight bandage, or ligature of any kind, should
be applied above the wound if the injury has
been received on any of the extremities,&mdash;which
is fortunately the case in the vast majority of
instances. The part bitten should be at once exposed,
and search made for the point of entrance
of the fangs. It should be particularly
noted as to whether there are one or two
wounds, as it is true in about one-half of the
cases that only one fang enters the flesh,&mdash;in
which case, of course, the probabilities of serious
consequences resulting are largely diminished.
With a pocket-knife or other sharp instrument<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
the wound should be enlarged, and, if
possible, someone should be persuaded to suck
the wound; this should not be done by one with
decayed teeth, as under such circumstances the
poison might be absorbed and produce unpleasant
consequences. A doctor should be summoned
as quickly as is possible, but it must be
confessed that in the present state of knowledge,
unless he should happen to possess&mdash;which
he probably will not&mdash;some antitoxin for
the particular snake doing the damage, his services
will likely be of no great value.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It has been asserted by some that very large doses
of strychnine are directly antidotal to snake venom,
but more recent experience does not tend to confirm
this view; still there is no harm in making the trial,
and if the services of someone capable of giving
the injections can be secured, the treatment is certainly
worth the trial. The immediate injection into
the tissues around the wound of a one-per-cent.
watery solution of chromic acid or potassium permanganate
is thought to be of value by destroying
the poison, but in order to be efficient it must be
administered within a short time after the bite has
been received. Should the patient's condition become
serious, and the breathing finally stop, artificial
respiration may be resorted to. As soon as the remedies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
suggested have been tried, it is time for us to
go back to the ligature, which cannot be suffered
to remain around the limb indefinitely, as by cutting
off the blood-supply it will sooner or later produce
death of the tissues. From time to time we should
slowly loosen the bandage, thus allowing a little of
the poison to pass into the body, and at the same
time permit the entrance of a small quantity of
blood into the tissues of the limb beyond the ligature;
the bandage should of course be tightened at the
end of a half a minute, and it should be alternately
loosened and tightened every half hour until the patient
is considered to be out of danger.</p></div>

<p>The reader cannot fail to have observed that
nothing has been said concerning the use of
alcohol in the treatment of snake-bite, and the
matter is only here referred to for the purpose
of condemning it as being unsound in theory
and bad in practice.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The idea that this drug is of value in snake bite
doubtless originally arose from the fact that those
bitten by poisonous serpents were depressed, and, as
in the past alcohol was considered the best of all
stimulants, it is not surprising that its use was generally
considered to be essential. As we now know,
however, that alcohol is a depressant rather than a
stimulant, and as numerous experiments carried out
on animals have clearly shown that it does harm in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>snake bite rather than good, there is every reason
why we should cease to endanger the lives of those
already poisoned by adding to the trouble by using
this drug. There is but little doubt that many more
persons have been killed by the alcoholic treatment
for snake bites than have died from the effects of
snake venom. Inasmuch as there is a deep-rooted
superstition among most people that alcohol is the
panacea for snake bite&mdash;and such notions die hard&mdash;it
may be well to say that all of the authenticated
cases of this character that have occurred in this
country have recently been collected, with the result
that it was shown that only about one man in ten
dies who is bitten by a venomous serpent, and it is,
therefore, quite easy to understand why alcohol has
maintained its reputation as being an antidote in
such cases&mdash;the chances being nine to one in the victim's
favor without any treatment whatever.</p></div>

<p>As soon as the patient's needs are attended
to, it is well to find if the snake that inflicted
the wound was killed, and an examination of it
should at once be made as by determining the
size and character of the reptile an accurate
forecast to the probable results may be made.
In many instances it will be found that the snake
was not venomous, it having made only a few
scratches which are of no more consequence than
the prick of a brier. If it be found that the serpent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
inflicting the wound belongs to one of the
groups already referred to, the probabilities of
a serious result will depend upon the size and
character of the snake, and also to a considerable
degree on whether one or both fangs entered
the victim's body. A full grown diamond-back
rattlesnake, which may attain the extreme
length of eight feet, is perhaps the most dangerous
of all the American poisonous reptiles,
though a fully grown coral-snake may be regarded
as almost, if not quite as, deadly. Next
to these a large sized cotton-mouth moccasin
is perhaps most to be dreaded, to be followed,
depending upon their size, by the other varieties
of rattlesnakes, the copperheads, and finally
the ground-rattler. The larger the serpent inflicting
the wound the greater is the result to
be dreaded; naturally it also follows that the
larger the individual bitten the less the danger.</p>

<h3>RECIPES FOR COOKING COMMON FOODS<br />
By <span class="smcap">Dr. Mary E. Lapham</span></h3>

<h4>PREPARATION OF MEATS</h4>


<p><i>Roast Beef.</i>&mdash;The problem of roasting beef is to
have it sufficiently cooked in the center without hardening
and over-cooking the outside. Burned edges
and a raw center testify to a lack of intelligence.</p>

<p>The English way of baking beef is to allow nine
minutes to the pound for a rib-roast and eight minutes
for a sirloin. Sprinkle pepper and salt over the meat
and sprinkle with flour. Pour a little boiling water
into the pan and bake in an oven hot enough to crisp
and brown peeled raw potatoes cooked in the same
pan. Do not forget to baste often. This method
gives a rich flavor to the beef and the gravy, but the
outside is apt to be cooked too hard while the inside
is not enough cooked. Too hot a fire tends to make
meat tough and dry.</p>

<p>The French have a safer way, especially for small
roasts. The beef is cooked in a cool oven&mdash;so cool
that a peeled, raw potato will cook tender without
browning. Allow about an hour and a quarter for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
four-pound rib-roast. In this way the heat penetrates
to the center without hardening the outside. When
properly done the outside is very little more cooked
than the inside, and the roast throughout is tender,
rare, and juicy, with no hard-burned edges. This
way of baking makes inferior beef more tender and
juicy than the English way. It has the disadvantage
of not leaving any gravy in the pan. When baked
after the English method the fat fries out into the
pan, and a delicious, rich, brown gravy may be made
by adding flour and water. Strain the juice through
a fine sieve and allow to stand a few minutes so as to
be able to skim or pour off all the grease. Do not
serve gravies with half an inch of pure grease on top.
It does not require a scientific education nor a herculean
effort to remove the grease.</p>

<p><i>Pot Roast.</i>&mdash;If the beef is of an inferior quality,
the best way to cook it is in a heavy iron kettle, preferably
with a sloping bottom. Sprinkle the meat
with salt and pepper; place a little fat in the bottom
of the kettle&mdash;enough to keep the meat from sticking&mdash;and
allow the roast to brown slowly for half an
hour. Now put a pint of boiling water in the pot.
Cover very closely and let it simmer on the back of
the stove for about four hours, adding small quantities
of hot water as necessary, and turning often.
When cooked take up the meat; skim the fat from
the gravy and thicken with flour.</p>

<p><i>Hamburg Steaks.</i>&mdash;Another way of preparing inferior
cuts of beef is to make Hamburg steaks. Chop
the meat in fine pieces. Season with salt, pepper and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
a little onion juice, and shape into thin cakes. Put
three or four slices of fat salt pork into a frying-pan,
and when brown remove it and place the steaks in
the fat. Fry four minutes; turn, and fry three more,
and serve on a hot platter. Put a tablespoonful of
flour into the fat and stir until brown. Gradually
add a cupful of water or preferably milk and boil
three minutes; season well, pour over the meat, and
serve immediately.</p>

<p><i>Broiled Beef.</i>&mdash;Broiling is the simplest, easiest, and
most delicious method of cooking meats, but, as a rule,
ignorance instinctively turns to the frying-pan, and
broiling is unknown in many homes. This is partly
due to not knowing how to manage the fire. It seems
so much easier to fry on top of the stove than to plan
beforehand an adequate preparation of the coals. It
is necessary to have a bed of clear, hot coals with no
smoke. Have the steak cut three-quarters of an inch
thick; place in a wire broiler; put over the coals and
cover with a baking-pan. Turn every minute or two
until the meat is sufficiently cooked. When done,
place on a hot platter, and season well with salt, pepper,
and butter. Serve immediately. It should take
about ten minutes to cook a steak or thick mutton
chop.</p>

<p><i>Fried Beef.</i>&mdash;If beef must be fried, have a hot fire;
heat a thick iron frying-pan and grease it just
enough to keep the meat from sticking. Have the
meat three-quarters of an inch thick; place in the hot
pan and turn as soon as it is well seared. Turn often
until done and then season well and serve at once.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
There should be no gravy in the pan; all the juices
should be in the meat.</p>

<p><i>Beef Hash.</i>&mdash;Take equal parts of beef and cold potatoes,
chopped moderately fine. Chop a small onion
and fry in plenty of butter until brown; add the meat
and potatoes and just enough milk to keep from sticking.
Cook for half an hour, stirring frequently.
Serve with thin, dry toast or toasted crackers.
Poached eggs are a very nice addition.</p>

<p><i>Veal.</i>&mdash;Veal, when properly cooked, is delicious and
delicate. Like pork it should be cooked slowly for a
long time to develop its full flavor. Unfortunately
it is usually half-cooked, tough, and insipid. The
housewife who can cook veal properly has a distinct
advantage over her less fortunate neighbor.</p>

<p><i>Leg Roast of Veal.</i>&mdash;Take out the bone and fill the
space with stuffing made as follows: Take one half-cupful
of chopped fat pork, or unsmoked bacon, and
fry with a finely chopped onion until delicately brown.
Add two cupfuls of bread crumbs; season with salt
and pepper and moisten with a little milk. Tie the
veal closely; sprinkle with pepper and salt; rub thoroughly
with flour and cover with buttered paper.
Into the baking-pan put a generous number of thin
slices of unsmoked bacon, an onion and half a can
of tomatoes. Add just enough boiling water to steam
the veal. Cook gently in a moderate oven, allowing
twenty-five minutes to the pound, and baste very frequently,
turning the meat about every half-hour.
When done, put it on a hot platter in the warming
oven, and add enough water to make the requisite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
amount of gravy. Thicken with browned flour, strain,
and pour over the roast.</p>

<p><i>Fried Veal.</i>&mdash;Fried veal steak or cutlets are delicious,
but very difficult to prepare properly. As a
usual thing veal cutlets are either half raw, or cooked
until dry and hard. When properly cooked veal
should be spongy, soft, and velvety. The chops
should be not quite a half inch thick. Melt a little
lard in a hot frying-pan; sprinkle some salt and pepper
on the veal and fry quickly until brown on both
sides. Then cover tightly, and place on the back of
the stove and steam until thoroughly tender. It requires
from forty to forty-five minutes to fry veal.</p>

<p><i>Broiled Veal.</i>&mdash;The veal should be cut thin, broiled
quickly until brown, and seasoned with salt, pepper,
and melted butter, to which a little chopped parsley
and lemon juice have been added. Serve on a hot
platter and eat at once. If the veal is fat, tender and
nicely broiled, it is almost as good as game.</p>

<p><i>Veal Stew or Pot-pie.</i>&mdash;Cut the meat from a knuckle
of veal into pieces not too small; put them into a pot
with some small pieces of salt pork, and plenty of
pepper and salt; pour over enough hot water to cover
it well, and boil until the meat is thoroughly done.
While the water is still boiling drop in, by the spoonful,
a batter made as follows: Two eggs well beaten,
two and a half or three cupfuls of buttermilk, one even
teaspoonful of soda, and flour enough to make a thick
batter. Cover the pot, and as soon as the batter is
well cooked serve it.</p>

<p><i>Veal Stew.</i>&mdash;This is an exceedingly nutritious, economical,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
and appetizing dish. Cut the veal into small
pieces about an inch square; add three or four thin
slices of salt pork; one or two onions and potatoes
cut up fine, and a little turnip, carrot, parsley and
celery, if you have them. Cover well with boiling
water and cook over a brisk fire until the meat is tender
and the water pretty well cooked away. This will
require about an hour. Cover the meat well with
fresh milk; season to taste with pepper, salt, and a
generous quantity of butter; let the mess simmer on
the back of the stove about twenty minutes, and serve
it in a hot covered dish.</p>

<p><i>Jellied Veal.</i>&mdash;Jellied veal gives the impression of
an expensive preparation, and yet nothing is cheaper
or simpler. Put a knuckle of veal into a pot that
can be tightly covered; season well with two or three
slices of unsmoked bacon, the heart of an onion, salt,
pepper and a little butter, adding just enough water
to steam the meat thoroughly (replenishing it from
time to time as needed), and cook over a slow fire
until tender&mdash;probably about four hours. When done
there should be about two teacupfuls of broth. Prepare
three cold hard-boiled eggs. Cut the veal into
pieces the size of a walnut. Now choose a dish just
large enough to hold the meat, the eggs and the
broth. Slice the eggs and place a few pieces on the
bottom of the dish. Now put in a layer of veal; then
more egg and continue in this way until the veal is
used. Strain the broth over the veal and set it away
in a cool place, preferably on ice, until quite firm.
When about to serve it, loosen by slipping a knife,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
warmed in water, between the meat and the dish.
Garnish with parsley or lettuce, and serve with salad
of any kind.</p>

<p><i>Roast Pork.</i>&mdash;Pork should be thoroughly cooked in
a medium hot oven. For the leg or the shoulder allow
twenty-five minutes to the pound. For the spareribs
allow fifteen minutes. Sprinkle the spareribs
well with salt, pepper, sage, and a little chopped
onion, or bake a few onions in the same dish. Put
a little water in the pan and add to it as it cooks
away. The leg, the loin, and the shoulder may be
stuffed with well-seasoned sage stuffing. To make
this, cut a few strips of fat pork into small dice and
fry over a slow fire. Add a finely chopped onion and
cook until brown. Crumble as many slices of dry
bread as you will need, and fry with the onion and
pork over a slow fire until nicely browned. Moisten a
little with milk or cream, and fill the space left by removing
the bones. Sew tightly together and bake
thoroughly. Peeled, raw potatoes are very nice baked
in the same dish with the pork. A medium sized
potato will require a little over an hour to bake in a
moderate oven. Apple sauce, sauerkraut, or cabbage
cooked with a little vinegar, are nice to serve with
pork.</p>

<p><i>Broiled Pork.</i>&mdash;Very thin slices cut from a leg of
pork, or the cutlets, or the chops, are extremely nice
and delicate when broiled. They must be cut thin;
the coals must be bright and hot; and the meat turned
very often. Serve on a hot platter.</p>

<p><i>Fried Pork.</i>&mdash;For frying, pork should not be cut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
over a half an inch thick: Cook slowly from forty
minutes to an hour, with the pan closely covered, to
keep in the steam. Pork requires a long, slow process
to develop its flavor and tenderness. Nearly everyone
cooks it too fast, and for too short a time. When
thoroughly steamed and nicely seasoned with salt,
pepper, sage and a little onion, well fed pork is as
toothsome and dainty as turkey. Make a brown gravy
and pour over the meat. Serve with apple sauce.</p>

<p><i>Boiled Pork.</i>&mdash;Take a leg of pork, or a shoulder, and
remove the bones. Tie closely together and let it cook
slowly in a tightly covered pot for half an hour, adding
a little fat if necessary to keep the meat from
sticking. Now sprinkle with salt, pepper and sage.
Put two whole onions in the pot, and just enough boiling
water to thoroughly steam the meat. Place it on
the back of the stove and cook over a slow fire for four
or five hours until thoroughly tender and velvety.
When done put on a hot platter in the warming-oven.
Thicken the gravy with flour, adding a little water or
milk if necessary, then let it boil for five minutes and
strain. When properly cooked this is delicious cold,
and almost as good for salad as chicken or turkey.
If desired, peeled raw potatoes may be browned in the
pot with the meat. These will take about an hour to
cook.</p>

<p><i>Curing Ham and Bacon.</i>&mdash;To have good ham and
bacon the meat must first be properly cured so that
the lean part is pink, tender and soft to the touch,
while the fat is clear and white. In many country
homes the lean meat is about as tough, hard, and indigestible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
as sole leather. A good recipe for curing is
as follows: For every gallon of water take two pounds
of coarse salt and one-half ounce of soda. Boil all
together and skim well, and, while hot, pour over the
meat. Put in a cold dry place with a stone to keep
the meat well below the water. After three weeks,
hang the meat and let it dry for two or three days before
smoking.</p>

<p><i>Broiled Ham.</i>&mdash;Nothing is more appetizing for supper
than broiled ham, served with mashed potatoes,
milk toast, or a poached egg on dry toast. Cut the
ham as thin as possible, and broil quickly over hot
coals, turning constantly until the fat begins to
shrivel. Have everything else ready so that it can be
eaten immediately. Cold cabbage salad is nice with
this.</p>

<p><i>Boiled Ham.</i>&mdash;If quite salty, soak the ham twenty-four
hours. Put it in a large kettle with a generous
supply of water, and allow twenty-five minutes to the
pound for boiling. Take the pot from the fire and
let the meat remain in the water until nearly cold.
Sprinkle with pepper and rub thoroughly with brown
sugar; put the ham and the fat from the liquor into
a baking-pan and brown for about an hour in the
oven. Cut as thin as possible when serving.</p>

<p><i>Frying Ham.</i>&mdash;Cut the ham in the thinnest possible
slices, with a large, sharp knife. Have the frying-pan
hot, and cook the meat just enough to give the fat
a delicate brown, turning frequently. To cook ham too
much is to make it tough, hard, dry, and indigestible.
Put the ham on a hot platter in the warming oven.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
Add a cupful, or more, of fresh milk to the grease and
thicken with flour. Serve with boiled potatoes. Instead
of making a gravy, eggs may be fried in the fat.
To do this nicely the fat must not be burned. The
eggs should be dropped in one by one, allowing them
plenty of room to spread out. Cook slowly and with
a spoon baste the yolks with the hot fat until they
sear, being careful not to cook the egg too hard.
These eggs are very nice served on thin, dry toast, or
one may be placed on each slice of ham.</p>

<p><i>Fried Bacon.</i>&mdash;Cut the bacon into very thin slices,
and cook in a hot frying-pan just long enough to turn
the fat to a delicate brown. If cooked too long it is
hard and indigestible, besides losing its delicacy of
flavor. A very nice way to cook bacon, instead of
frying it, is to roll the slices up into curls, skewer
them with toothpicks, and place them in a baking-pan
on the grate of a hot oven until they are slightly
brown. Serve on dry toast. They should be eaten
at once.</p>

<p><i>Broiled Bacon.</i>&mdash;Bacon can be broiled like ham. A
very nice way to serve it, especially for an invalid,
is to toast it before the fire; split a hot biscuit and
make a sandwich with the bacon. Bacon toasted this
way and eaten when very hot has a peculiarly appetizing
flavor.</p>

<p><i>Unsmoked Bacon.</i>&mdash;Cut in thin slices; roll in flour
or meal; dust lightly with pepper; fry over a moderately
hot fire until delicately brown and crisp, and
put on a warm platter in the warming closet. Add
sufficient fresh milk to the fat to make the requisite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
amount of gravy. Season with a little salt and pepper,
and thicken with flour. Do not pour over the
meat. Serve in separate dish.</p>

<p><i>Boiled Mutton.</i>&mdash;Mutton should be cooked very much
like beef,&mdash;just enough to leave a faint pink, but not
enough to make it hard and develop a strong taste.
For boiled mutton allow ten minutes to the pound.
Add a little rice to make the meat whiter and tenderer.
Cover with boiling water and cook rapidly for fifteen
minutes; then place on the back of the stove where
it will simmer nicely for two hours. Young turnips,
boiled with the mutton are a very nice addition.</p>

<p><i>Mutton Cutlets.</i>&mdash;The chops should be thick.
Grease the bottom of a hot frying-pan just enough
to keep the chops from sticking; place over a hot fire,
and turn the meat constantly to keep it from burning
until the center is a faint pink. Season with salt,
pepper, and melted butter to which a little lemon juice
and parsley may be added.</p>

<p><i>Roast Mutton.</i>&mdash;The French roast mutton in a slow
oven in order that the heat may penetrate to the center
without injuring the outside. Allow twenty minutes
to the pound, or, if a very large roast, twenty-five
minutes may not be too much, providing the oven
is not too hot. Season with salt and pepper, and put
a generous supply of boiling water in the pan. Baste
frequently, and turn the meat every half hour. Place
two or three peeled raw potatoes in the pan, and watch
them; if they begin to brown, the oven is too hot.
The potatoes should keep pace with the mutton, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
when the latter is half done the former should be
cooked to the same degree.</p>

<p><i>Broiled Mutton Chops.</i>&mdash;The chops should be cut an
inch thick. Trim off the fat and scrape the bones.
Roll in a little melted butter or oil, and broil over a
hot fire, turning constantly until just pink within.
Have ready a mound of hot mashed potatoes and lay
the chops around it. Pour a little melted butter over
them and serve with green peas.</p>


<h4>PROPER COOKING OF CEREALS.</h4>

<p>Starchy foods in any form must be well cooked.
Gluey, slimy oatmeal, full of hard lumps of half-cooked
grains, the whole forming a raw, horrid mass,
is very different from the smooth, well cooked, easily
digestible, oatmeal prepared by a good cook. Rolled
oats are more easily cooked than oatmeal, as they are
already prepared. For four people, put a quarter of
a teaspoonful of salt into four cups of <i>hot</i> water and
stir in slowly one cup of rolled oats, being careful not
to allow lumps to form. Cook for an hour in a double
boiler.</p>

<p><i>Hominy.</i>&mdash;Hominy is seldom well cooked. It is
often lumpy and raw, and yet has a burned taste
which comes from being cooked in too little water,
while if too much is used it goes all to soup and can
never be made good. Salt a quart of boiling water,
and very carefully stir into it a cup of hominy. Stir
often and add a little water from time to time if it
gets too dry. Cook until every grain is thoroughly
done.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Rice.</i>&mdash;Rice is rarely well prepared, the greatest
trouble being to get each grain well cooked without
making it mushy. When properly cooked each
grain will be firm and distinct, and at the same time
soft and tender. Wash half a cupful of rice thoroughly,
put it in a quart of boiling salted water, and
let it boil for half an hour; then drain it thoroughly
and steam it in a colander for an hour.</p>

<p><i>Corn-Bread.</i>&mdash;Corn-bread should be something
like rice: every particle thoroughly cooked and soft,
and yet not sticking together, so that the inside is
dry and crumbly while the outside is crisp and
nutty. The thinner corn-bread is baked the more
perfectly it cooks. It should not be more than an
inch thick and preferably less. A cannon-ball of
raw meal, with only the thinnest of surfaces decently
baked, is an insult to a man's intelligence
as well as to his digestion. This is the way to prepare
it properly. Sift a teaspoonful of baking
powder into a pint of corn meal. Mix in a piece of
butter the size of a walnut and add sweet milk until
you get a dough that can be kneaded into a cake.
Bake in a hot oven until brown and well done. A
little richer corn-bread is made by heating a pint
of sweet milk and pouring it over a pint of corn-meal.
Melt a piece of butter the size of a walnut,
beat two eggs, add a little salt, and mix well into
the meal. Put in a shallow dish, and bake about a
half hour in a quick oven.</p>

<p><i>Biscuits.</i>&mdash;Biscuits should be thin, crisp, delicately
browned and free from flour. The inside of a biscuit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
should be flaky and dry. Thick, soggy, heavy
biscuits impose a severe task upon digestion. Make
the biscuits about two inches in diameter, and
three-quarters of an inch thick. Bake them brown
on both the top and the bottom. It is much easier to
make light, wholesome biscuits with baking-powder
than with soda. Buttermilk biscuits are very delicate
and palatable, but not quite so certain to turn
out well. If soda is not properly used you will have
a yellow, evil-smelling compound, or else there will
not be enough soda to make the biscuits rise, and
they will be dangerously heavy. To make soda-biscuits
sift one level teaspoonful of soda, one half-teaspoonful
salt, and one quart of flour together three
times so as to get the soda thoroughly well mixed in.
Now rub two tablespoons of lard into the flour and add
enough buttermilk to make a soft dough. Roll out
into a sheet, cut into small thin biscuits and bake
in a hot oven until well browned. Baking-powder
biscuits are made in the same way, by using two teaspoonfuls
of baking-powder in place of the soda, and
sweet milk instead of buttermilk.</p>

<p><i>Yeast.</i>&mdash;Put three hops in a pot containing two
quarts of cold water. Place on the stove and see that
it boils twenty minutes. Have a pint of flour in a
large bowl and mix into it a tablespoonful of sugar,
one of salt and a teaspoonful of ginger. Strain the
water from the hops into this, stirring constantly.
Allow it to cool. When lukewarm put in a cup of
yeast or a yeast-cake.</p>

<p><i>Rolls.</i>&mdash;At night take one half-cup of lukewarm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
water, one half-teaspoonful of salt, three-quarters of
a cup of yeast, and enough flour to make a thin
batter. In the morning add to this a pint of milk,
a teaspoonful of sugar, a half-cup of butter and beat
in flour until it is no longer sticky. Set it in a warm
place to rise and when well up knock back. Repeat
this process, and when it comes up the third time
make it into rolls. Let it rise once more and then
bake it.</p>


<h4>METHODS WITH CHICKEN.</h4>

<p>The simplest and easiest way to cook chicken is
to fry it. A poorly fed chicken is better stewed.
For baking and broiling the chicken must be fat.
In whatever way the chicken is cooked there is
danger of its being tough, dry, stringy, and tasteless.
Plain, artless, boiling results in insipidity. Quick,
superficial frying means tough stringy fibres; and a
hot oven frequently dries the meat until it is not fit
to eat.</p>

<p><i>Fried Chicken.</i>&mdash;All housewives think they can fry
chicken, but the results are vastly different, according
to the way it is done. You may have a tender,
rich, delicious morsel, or tough masses of meat,
stringy, tasteless and almost impossible to chew. Of
course the condition of the chicken has a great deal
to do with the results. A tender, well-fed chicken
will fry far better and much more quickly than a
thin, scrawny one. The thinner the chicken the
greater the necessity for care in cooking it. It
must be cooked slowly, over a moderate fire, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
a tightly covered pan, until it is perfectly tender.
Melt a little fat in the frying-pan; flour, salt,
and pepper the pieces of chicken and fry them in
the fat until nicely browned on both sides. Now
cover closely and place on the back of the stove where
the chicken will steam for half an hour. When tender
take up on a hot platter and put in the warming
oven. Make a rich, brown gravy and pour over it.</p>

<p><i>Boiled Chicken.</i>&mdash;Chickens may be boiled whole or
cut into pieces. To boil whole place a few pieces of
unsmoked bacon in a stew-pan that is deep enough
to hold the chicken and can be tightly covered. Cook
slowly for an hour without adding water, turning
it often until it is evenly browned. Now add a small
onion, some raw peeled potatoes not larger than an
egg, and a little boiling water. Cook over a brisk
fire for three-quarters of an hour. Salt and pepper
the chicken and put it and the potatoes in a baking-dish
in a hot oven while making the gravy. A couple
of hard-boiled eggs chopped very fine, and a little
chopped parsley, improve the gravy.</p>

<p><i>Baked Chicken.</i>&mdash;A properly baked chicken is
tender, juicy, and has a rich flavor, while one improperly
baked is tough, dry, stringy, and tasteless.
To bake a chicken properly the oven must not be
too hot; the chicken must be repeatedly basted, and
cooked until it is tender, but not until all dried up.
Stuffing the chicken improves the flavor. To make
the dressing, melt enough of any kind of wholesome
fat in a hot frying-pan to keep the bread crumbs
from sticking, and fry in it a large onion, chopped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
fine, until it is tender. Place the dry bread-crumbs
into the fat, and cook for half an hour over a slow
fire, stirring often to keep from sticking, until the
crumbs are slightly browned and well dried. Season
with salt, pepper and a little celery-salt, and moisten
with just enough milk to make it stick together.
Always taste the dressing to see if it is properly
seasoned. A well-fed chicken can be baked more
rapidly than a thin one. If the chicken is thin add
plenty of fat to the water in the baking-pan; cover
closely and cook slowly and carefully until it is
tender, turning very often; if it is fat and well-fed
put plenty of wholesome grease in the baking-dish,
and without covering it, cook in a hot oven, basting
frequently. A young, fat chicken will bake in an
hour. An older fowl may require two or three
hours. It is a good plan to allow the chicken plenty
of time and then, if done too soon, to cover it closely
and keep it warm on the back of the stove. Use
just enough water while baking to keep the fat from
sputtering. If the water is cooked out towards the
end, and the chicken is thoroughly basted, the skin
will take on a rich, thick glazing that is highly creditable
to the skill of the cook. Delicious gravy can be
made of the fat by adding milk and thickening with
flour.</p>

<p><i>Smothered Chicken.</i>&mdash;Use a frying-size chicken.
Split it down the back and rub with a little salt.
Put it in a pan with a slice of bacon and a pint
of water. Cover the pan closely and let it simmer
on top of the stove from one to two hours, or until<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
the chicken is thoroughly tender. When done
sprinkle with flour and baste well. Add a small
tablespoon of butter, and put in the oven and cook
until brown.</p>

<p><i>Broiled Chicken.</i>&mdash;A young, tender, fat chicken is
better broiled than any other way. It has a finer
flavor; is tenderer, more juicy and more easily
digested; in fact broiled chicken is one of the most
delicious dishes that can be served. There is no
earthly use, however, in trying to broil a chicken that
is not fat and nice. If the chicken is a little too
old to broil whole the breast will still be tender.
Flatten the chicken by pounding it. Have a bed of
clear, bright coals and a hot gridiron well greased to
prevent sticking. Cover with a baking-dish and
turn often, allowing the bony side to stay down
longer than the other side. From fifteen to twenty
minutes should be enough, but it is always best to
test with a fork by pulling the fibres apart to see
that they are not raw. As soon as the raw look has
disappeared the chicken is done. The least over-cooking
injures the flavor. Serve on a hot platter.
Pour over a little melted butter, seasoned with lemon
juice and chopped parsley.</p>

<p>To bake or boil a turkey proceed the same as for
chicken, simply allowing more time. An eight-pound
turkey will require three hours to roast.</p>


<h4>MAKING GOOD SOUPS.</h4>

<p><i>Vegetable Soups.</i>&mdash;The simplest and most easily
prepared soups are those made from peas, beans,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
tomatoes, asparagus, celery, carrots, onions, and
potatoes. They require neither meat nor any previous
preparation, but can be made and eaten at once.
These soups are somewhat paradoxical because they
are both cheap and rich; deliciously simple and simply
delicious. Take enough of any of these vegetables
to furnish sufficient soup after they have been
rubbed through a strainer and thinned with milk
or cream. Cook the vegetables thoroughly until perfectly
soft, so that they can be easily rubbed through
a coarse strainer. Add enough milk to this pur&eacute;e
to make it about the thickness of cream. Season with
salt, pepper, and a little celery-salt, and serve with
bits of bread browned crisp in the oven.</p>

<p>When the vegetables can be got fresh from the
garden nothing is more delicious than these soups,
and in winter, canned peas and dried beans make
excellent substitutes. In making potato pur&eacute;e two
onions boiled with the potatoes improve the flavor.
Potato soup without onion is tasteless; a little celery
boiled in with the potatoes and onion, makes it still
nicer. Tomato soup is also better slightly flavored
with onion and a little carrot. A little cold boiled
rice, simmered for a half-hour in the soup after the
milk has been added, is an excellent addition. These
soups are also delicious when made rather thin with
milk and then thickened by putting the well-beaten
yolks of two eggs into the hot soup-tureen, and stirring
vigorously while adding the soup; this last soup
must be served at once, as it cannot stand after the
eggs are added.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Meat Soups.</i>&mdash;These soups should always be made
the day before required in order to thoroughly remove
the fat, which cannot be done until it hardens
on the top of the soup. Nothing is more disgusting
than greasy soup. The foundation for an infinite
variety of soups is made by boiling about a pound
of meat in three pints of water. After the meat is
cooked to pieces strain it out and keep the well-skimmed
liquor, or &ldquo;stock,&rdquo; as it is called, in a
stone jar in a cool place. It should form a jelly,
and in order to prepare a different soup for each
day, it is only necessary to heat some of the jelly and
flavor it differently. For instance: Chop fine one
small onion to each person and fry it in butter, or
in some of the grease taken off the soup, until tender
and slightly brown. Pour over enough stock and let
stand for half an hour. Serve with a little grated
cheese. Cabbage soup is made in the same way except
that it takes longer to cook the cabbage. Instead
of one vegetable several may be used. Turnips,
cabbage, onions, and carrots in about the same proportion,
chopped fine and fried tender, without any
water, and added to the soup, make what is known in
France as Julienne soup.</p>


<h4>EGGS IN SEVERAL FORMS.</h4>

<p><i>Coddled Eggs.</i>&mdash;The most delicate way to cook an
egg is to coddle it. Put six into a vessel that will
hold two quarts. Fill with boiling water, cover
closely, and let it stand in a warm place for ten
minutes. If you desire them better cooked let them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
stay in the water longer. If you want to do but one
egg, put it in a quart of boiling water, cover and let
stand five minutes.</p>

<p><i>Shirred Eggs.</i>&mdash;To shirr an egg break it into a
saucer or any small dish that has been well greased.
Put into a hot oven and leave until glazed. Season
and serve at once.</p>

<p><i>Scrambled Eggs.</i>&mdash;Heat a teaspoonful of milk to
each egg in a sauce-pan not more than a quarter of an
inch deep and about the right size to hold the quantity
of eggs desired. Add a little salt, pepper, and butter.
When hot put in the eggs, and as they lie on
the bottom of the pan, scrape off with a spoon letting
the raw part take the place of those portions already
cooked, and continue this until a creamy custard is
formed. Be careful not to cook the eggs so long that
this custard is changed to a hard mass.</p>


<h4>PROPER COOKING OF VEGETABLES.</h4>

<p>The general tendency in cooking vegetables is to
use altogether too much water so that they become
soaked and tasteless. The ideal way to cook most
vegetables is to use as little water as possible; just
a little in the bottom of the pot so that the vegetables
will not stick and burn, but steam through in their
own juices until thoroughly tender and full of their
own flavor. The fire should not be too hot; the pot
should be tightly covered; a sufficient amount of
butter must be added when the vegetable is about
half done; and plenty of time given to allow it
to simmer and steam until thoroughly flavored.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
Onions, beans, carrots, and cabbage are most delicate
when chopped fine, cooked until tender in a
very little water, seasoned with salt, pepper, and
butter, covered with milk, and allowed to stand on
the back of the stove for twenty minutes until the
flavor is thoroughly developed.</p>

<p><i>Boiled Potatoes.</i>&mdash;Potatoes should not be peeled
before boiling, but should be thoroughly washed and
rinsed. They should be put in an abundance of
boiling water, well salted, and covered tightly.
When tender pour off all the water, cover the pot
with a towel and let it stand on the back of the stove
for ten minutes.</p>

<p><i>Baked Potatoes.</i>&mdash;If baked potatoes stand they lose
their flavor. A baked potato, eaten as soon as done,
is sweet, dry and mealy. Allow them to stand even
for ten minutes and the flavor is lost, and they become
wet and tasteless. A pleasant change is to
peel the potatoes before baking. These must be
eaten as soon as they come from the oven or they lose
their crispness.</p>

<p><i>Beans.</i>&mdash;Nothing is more valuable for winter food
than beans. They give as much strength as beefsteak
and are far less expensive. Soak them in
plenty of water over night; add a generous piece of
unsmoked bacon; let simmer on the back of the stove
until they are tender and the water is well cooked
away; cover with milk, and either let them stand
on the back of the stove until the milk is thickened,
or put them into a shallow baking-dish and bake
until nearly dry. Serve either hot or cold.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>


<h4>SOME CAPITAL DESSERTS.</h4>

<p><i>Apple Pudding.</i>&mdash;Peel and slice enough apples to
nearly fill your pudding-dish, sugar to taste, and
grate over them a little nutmeg. Also add a little
water. Now make a batter as follows: Three
quarters of a cup of sugar; a piece of butter the size
of a small egg, one half-cup of milk, one egg, a
pinch of salt, a teaspoonful of baking-powder, and
one and one-eighth cups of flour. This is an extremely
nice, wholesome pudding, which can be
served with either cream or hard sauce.</p>

<p>To make hard sauce take a half-cup of butter and
cream it with a fork; add a cupful of sugar and
beat until nicely mixed and creamy. Flavor to taste
and sprinkle a little nutmeg over it.</p>

<p><i>Cottage Pudding.</i>&mdash;One cupful of sugar, one tablespoonful
of butter, one half-cupful of milk, two
eggs, one and one-half cupfuls of flour, and one teaspoonful
of baking-powder. For the sauce, take
three and a half cupfuls of boiling water and stir
in it a cupful of sugar, and a tablespoonful of either
flour or corn-starch rubbed smooth with a little cold
water. Cook well for two or three minutes; take
the pan from the fire, add the butter and flavor as
you prefer.</p>

<p><i>Batter Pudding Boiled or Baked.</i>&mdash;One quart of
milk, six eggs beaten separately, six tablespoonfuls
of flour worked gradually into the yolks of the eggs,
and a pinch of salt. Bake or boil about three-quarters
of an hour. Serve with sauce.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Cream of Corn-starch.</i>&mdash;One quart of milk, four
eggs, one half-cupful sugar, four tablespoonfuls of
corn-starch dissolved in a little milk. Into a pint
of the milk put the sugar, and place on the stove
to heat. When very hot gradually stir in the corn-starch
and beat well. Have ready the whites of the
eggs, and beat them into the milk; flavor as preferred.
Take the other pint of milk, the four yolks
and four light tablespoonfuls of sugar, and place
them over the fire, stirring constantly. This makes
a nice custard. Just before serving pour the custard
over the pudding.</p>

<p><i>Caramel Custard.</i>&mdash;One egg for each person; also
one teaspoonful of milk for each person. Put the
yolks and milk together with a tablespoonful of
sugar to each egg. Have ready some caramel, and stir
in enough to give a decided flavor. Put this into
cups or baking-dishes, and set in a pan of hot water
on top of the stove for twenty minutes; then in the
oven until the custard sets. Serve cold. For the
caramel, take two cupfuls of sugar (preferably
brown) and put it in a frying-pan with a teaspoonful
of water. Cook until well burned. Add a cup of
water, and, when cold, put it in a bottle or fruit-jar.
This quantity will last a long time.</p>

<p><i>Brown Betty Pudding.</i>&mdash;Take a cupful of grated
bread-crumbs, two cupfuls of finely chopped, tart
apples, half a cupful of brown sugar, a teaspoonful
of cinnamon, and one tablespoonful of butter. Butter
a deep pudding-dish, and put a layer of apples on
the bottom; then sprinkle with sugar, cinnamon and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
bits of the butter. Put in another layer of apples,
and proceed as before until all the ingredients have
been used. Cover the dish and bake for three-quarters
of an hour in a moderate oven; remove the
cover now and brown the pudding. Serve with sugar
and cream.</p>

<p><i>Rice Pudding.</i>&mdash;One cupful of boiled rice (better
if still hot), three cupfuls of milk, three-quarters of
a cup of sugar, a tablespoonful of corn-starch, and
two eggs; add flavoring. Dissolve the corn-starch
with a little of the milk, and stir it into the rest of
the milk; also add the yolks of the eggs and the
sugar beaten together. Put this over the fire and
when hot add the rice. Stir it carefully until it begins
to thicken, then take it off and add the flavoring.
Put it into a pudding-dish and bake in the oven.</p>
